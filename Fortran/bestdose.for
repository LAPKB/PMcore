C  BESTDOS121.FOR                                          6/10/16

C  BESTDOS121 HAS THE FOLLOWING CHANGES FROM BESTDOS120:

C  THIS PROGRAM IS NOW COMPATIBLE WITH THE NEW "DENSITY OCT_15"
C  DENSITY FILE MADE BY THE NEW NPAG PROGRAM (NPAG120.FOR/npagranfix6.f)
C  WHICH HAS NRANFIX PARAMETERS. 

C  THE CHANGES NECESSARY ARE IN READING IN THE POTENTIAL NRANFIX 
C  PARAMETER NAMES AND VALUES IN THE NPAGDENFILE. THEN THESE VALUES,
C  WHICH WERE ESTIMATED IN THE ORIGINAL NPAG RUN, ARE TREATED JUST THE 
C  SAME AS THE FIXED PARAMETER VALUES WHICH FIXED IN THE NPAG RUN.

C-----------------------------------------------------------------------

C  BESTDOS120.FOR                                          2/19/16

C  BESTDOS120 HAS ONE SMALL CHANGE FROM BESTDOS119. IN THE CODE BELOW 
C  FORMAT 8133 IN MAIN, THE CONTINGENCY ON IPRIOR IS REMOVED. THIS 
C  SHOULD HAVE BEEN DONE IN BESTDOS105.FOR, WHEN IPRIOR WAS NO LONGER
C  READ IN, BUT THE EFFECT WAS THE SAME SINCE IF IPRIOR = 0 (WHICH IS
C  THE DEFAULT FOR NON-INITIALIZED VARIABLES IN MOST COMPILERS), IERRMOD
C  IS WRITTEN TO FILE 24 AS IT SHOULD BE. BUT BECAUSE SOME OPERATING 
C  SYSTEMS/COMPILERS MAY ASSIGN RANDOM NOS. TO VARIABLES WHICH ARE NOT
C  INITIALIZED, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT IPRIOR COULD BE SET TO SOMETHING
C  NON-0, WHICH WOULD MEAN THAT IERRMOD WOULD NOT BE WRITTEN TO FILE 24.
C  SO THIS CHANGE WILL REMOVE THAT POSSIBLE BUG. NOTE THAT IPRIOR IS 
C  ALSO REMOVED AS A CALLING ARGUMENT TO SUBROUTINE VERIF1.

C-----------------------------------------------------------------------

C  BESTDOS119.FOR                                          7/7/14

C  BESTDOS119 HAS THE FOLLOWING CHANGES FROM BESTDOS118:

C  1. THIS PROGRAM NOW ALLOWS STEADY STATE DOSING IN THE "PAST" (NOT
C  THE FUTURE). THIS REQUIRES:

C  MODULE IDM1X14.FOR IS UPDATED TO IDM1X15.FOR, WHICH HAS JUST A
C  COUPLE OF SMALL CHANGES FROM IDM1X15.F (WHICH IS ALREADY USED IN THE
C  NPAG "ENGINE").

C  MODULE IDM3X141.FOR IS UPDATED TO IDM3X151.FOR, WHICH IS 
C  SIMILAR TO IDM3X15.F (WHICH IS ALREADY USED IN THE NPAG "ENGINE"),
C  BUT WITH THE CHANGE THAT IDM3X141.FOR MADE TO IDM3X14.FOR,
C  (DIMENSIONS OF 71281 CHANGED TO 72000).

C  MODULE CALCBST14.FOR IS UPDATED TO CALCBST15.FOR.

C  MODULE NPAGFULL.FOR IS UPDATED TO BE NPAGFULLA.FOR.

C  MODULE NPAGFULL11.FOR IS UPDATED TO BE NPAGFULLA11.FOR.

C  FORMAT 1416 IS EDITED TO INDICATE THAT STEADY STATE DOSE SETS AT THE
C  BEGINNING OF THE PATIENT FILE ARE ALLOWED. BUT NOT DOSE OR TIME
C  RESETS. AND A NEW CHECK IS PUT IN SUBROUTINE READBLOCK2 TO DISALLOW
C  IDEVENT = 4 (DOSE RESETS).

C  NOTE THAT SUBROUTINE CALCTPRED IS MODIFIED TO REALLOW STEADY STATE
C  DOSE SETS (THE CODE TO ALLOW THESE SETS WAS REMOVED AS OF 
C  BESTDOS109.FOR). AND THE SAME IS TRUE FOR SUBROUTINE CALCTPRED2.


C  2. JUST BEFORE THE FIRST CALL FILRED(..) STATEMENT, SUBROUTINE
C  NEWWORK1 IS CALLED TO READ THE PATIENT DATA FROM FILE 27, AND 
C  CONVERT IT TO PATIENT DATA ON FILE 37, WITH EACH STEADY STATE DOSE
C  INDICATOR RESULTING IN AN EXTRA 100 DOSE SETS (WITH THE NEGATIVE DOSE
C  TIME LEFT IN - SEE COMMENTS BELOW).NOTE THAT THIS SUBROUTINE NEWWORK1
C  IS THE SAME AS IN THE CURRENT NPAG "ENGINE" MODULE, npageng25.f,
C  EXCEPT IT READS FILE 27 AND WRITES TO FILE 37, RATHER THAN READING
C  FROM FILE 23 AND WRITING TO FILE 27; ARRAY TIMOBREL IS NOT
C  ESTABLISHED IN NEWWORK1, AND NOT PASSED AS AN ARGUMENT (IT IS NOT
C  NEEDED IN THIS PROGRAM); MAXSUB IS ALSO NOT PASSED AS AN 
C  ARGUMENT (IT IS NOT NEEDED); NSUB IS NOT PASSED AS AN ARGUMENT (IT
C  IS NOT NEEDED); AND COMMON/DOSEOBS AND THE ARRAYS IN IT ARE DELETED
C  (THEY ARE NOT NEEDED).

C  NOTE THAT THIS NEWWORK1 ROUTINE IS INCLUDED IN THE NPAGFULLA.FOR
C  MODULE, AS IS SUBROUTINE ORDERDELTA.


C  3. SUBROUTINE MAKETMP NOW RETURNS ND42 RATHER THAN ND41. THE REASON
C  IS THAT IF THE PATIENT FILE HAS STEADY STATE DOSING, ND41 WILL
C  CHANGE AFTER NEW SUBROUTINE NEWWORK1 (SEE CHANGE 2. ABOVE) IS CALLED
C  (I.E., THERE WILL BE A LOT MORE DOSES IN THE "PAST"), BUT ND42 WILL
C  NOT (THERE ARE NO STEADY STATE DOSES IN THE "FUTURE").
C  SO ND41 AND NDD41 ARE NOW ESTABLISHED AFTER NEWWORK1 IS CALLED,
C  IN THE CASE THAT INCLUDPAST = 1.


C  4. SUBROUTINE FILRED IS CHANGED TO READ FILE 37, RATHER THAN 
C  FILE 27. 


C  5. IF THE PROGRAM BOMBS, THE MESSAGE THAT IS WRITTEN TO THE SCREEN
C  WILL NOW ALSO BE WRITTEN TO THE FILE ERRFIL = ERRORxxxx, WHERE xxxx
C  IS THE 4-DIGIT RUN NO. IN THIS WAY, IF THE PROGRAM IS BEING RUN USING
C  Pmetrics, THE Pmetrics PROGRAM CAN RESPOND APPROPRIATELY. NOTE THAT
C  ERRFIL IS PASSED TO ALL THE ROUTINES WHICH COULD WRITE TO IT
C  USING COMMON/ERROR/ERRFIL.

C  NOTE THAT CODE TO READ extnum TO GET THE 4-DIGIT JOB NUMBER IS
C  ADDED ALSO TO THE 'GUICMDS.INX' CODE, JUST AFTER PATH IS READ IN,
C  BECAUSE ERRFIL MAY HAVE TO BE WRITTEN TO DURING THAT PART OF THE
C  CODE ALSO.


C  6. THE MAXIMUM NO. OF OUTPUT EQUATIONS WILL BE CHANGED FROM 6 TO 7,
C  AND TO FACILITATE ANY FUTURE SUCH CHANGES, THIS NUMBER WILL BE SET
C  = MAXNUMEQ (SO ONLY THE PARAMETER STATEMENT WILL HAVE TO BE CHANGED
C  IN THE FUTURE). RATHER THAN PASS MAXNUMEQ TO ALL THE RELEVANT 
C  SUBROUTINES (AS IS DONE IN NPAG113.FOR AND IT2B110.FOR), THIS 
C  PROGRAM WILL JUST HAVE MAXNUMEQ SET IN A PARAMETER STATEMENT IN ALL
C  THESE ROUTINES. AND NOTE THAT IN THOSE SUBROUTINES, ANY 6
C  REFERRING TO THE MAX. NO. OF OUTPUT EQUATIONS WILL BE CHANGED TO
C  MAXNUMEQ.


C  7.  SUBROUTINE DETECT, AND THE ROUTINES IT CALLS, ARE REMOVED FROM
C  THE CODE. NOTE IN THE COMMENTS TO BESTDOS8.FOR, DETECT AND THE 
C  ROUTINE IT CALLED WERE NO LONGER NEEDED, BUT WERE LEFT IN THIS FILE
C  IN CASE THEY WERE NEEDED IN THE FUTURE. BUT IF THAT SHOULD OCCUR,
C  THESE ROUTINES CAN BE COPIED BACK IN FROM PROGRAM BESTDOS118.FOR.


C  8. A BUG IS FIXED IN SUBROUTINE WSUMSQ IN NEW MODULE CALCBST15.FOR.
C  IT WAS IN THE IF(ITARGET .EQ. 2) PORTION OF THE CODE. AUC IS NO
C  LONGER SET BACK TO 0 IF TPRED(I) = TNEXT ... SINCE AUCs ARE 
C  CUMULATIVE FROM TIME 0 IN THE "PAST", AS OF BESTDOS118.FOR. THIS
C  BUG EXISTED ONLY IN BESTDOS118.FOR.


C  9. SUBROUTINE PUTORDER2 IS REMOVED; INSTEAD SUBROUTINE CALCTPRED2
C  WILL CALL PUTORDER, WHICH HAS THE SAME CODE (AT ONE POINT, THESE
C  TWO ROUTINES HAD A DIFFERENT DIMENSION FOR XX, BUT THIS IS NO
C  LONGER TRUE; AND SO PUTORDER2 BECAME REDUNDANT). 


C  10. ALL REFERENCES TO THE TEMPLATE MODEL FILE TSTMULTK.FOR ARE
C  REPLACED BY TSTMULTM.FOR.

C-----------------------------------------------------------------------

C  BESTDOS118.FOR                                          11/13/13


C  BESTDOS118 HAS THE FOLLOWING CHANGE TO BESTDOS117:

C  THE CODE IN MAIN CHANGES SO THAT THE AUCs WRITTEN TO DOSEROUTxxxx 
C  WILL BE CUMULATIVE AUCs FROM TIME 0 IN THE "PAST", RATHER THAN BE
C  RESET TO 0 AT TNEXT (= TIME 0 IN THE "FUTURE"). BUT NOTE THAT THE
C  CODE IN WSUMSQ (IN CALCBST14.FOR) IS UNCHANGED, SO THAT AUCs IN THE
C  "FUTURE" ARE STILL ASSUMED TO BE RELATIVE TO THE BEGINNING OF THE 
C  "FUTURE", AND ARE RESET TO 0 AT TIME TNEXT.

C-----------------------------------------------------------------------

C  BESTDOS117.FOR                                          11/4/13

C  BESTDOS117 HAS THE FOLLOWING CHANGES TO BESTDOS116:

C  1. IT HAS A BUG FIX TO BESTDOS116. BELOW THE 2ND CALL TO ELDERY,
C  JUST ABOVE WHERE THE DOSEROUTxxxx FILE IS ESTABLISHED, FILE 27 IS
C  REWOUND AND FILRED IS CALLED AGAIN. THIS IS DONE TO RE-ESTABLISH THE
C  ORIGINAL DOSE VALUES INTO THE RS(.,.) ARRAY. THE REASON IS THAT 
C  ELDERY CALLS CALCS, WHICH CALLS WSUMSQ, WHICH SETS THE RS(.,.) VALUES
C  TO THE CURRENT CANDIDATES SUPPLIED BY ELDERY. AND IF THESE VALUES 
C  HAPPEN TO BE SET = 0, THEN THE CODE TO WRITE OUT THE OPTIMAL DOSES
C  IN MAIN (WHICH DEPEND ON RS(I,2*J-1) OR RS(I,2*J) BEING > 0 TO 
C  IDENTIFY AN IV OR A BOLUS, RESPECTIVELY) WILL NOT BE ENGAGED. AND
C  THEN THE #OPTIMAL DOSES LINE WILL BE FOLLOWED BY NO DOSES AT ALL.
C  IN ADDITION, THE CODE TO ESTABLISH THE BEST DOSES INTO RS(.,.) FOR
C  THE PURPOSE OF WRITING THE PREDICTED VALUES FOR THESE BEST DOSES,
C  FOR EACH GRID PT. IN THE PARAMETER DENSITY, WILL NOT BE ENGAGED
C  EITHER.

C  2. THE NAME "XLAM" IS CHANGED TO BIASWEIGHT TO REMOVE ANY
C  CONFUSION WITH LAMBDA, WHICH IS A TERM USED IN THE ASSAY ERROR
C  FUNCTION. SIMILARLY, IN THE OUTPUT FILE, "LAMDA" IS CHANGED TO
C  "BIASWEIGHT".

C  3. THE SAME "XLAM" TO "BIASWEIGHT" CHANGE IS MADE IN THE NEW
C  CALCBST14.FOR (WHICH REPLACES CALCBST13.FOR).


C-----------------------------------------------------------------------

C  BESTDOS116.FOR                                          10/16/13

C  BESTDOS116 HAS THE FOLLOWING CHANGES TO BESTDOS115:

C  IF THE USER SELECTS ITARGET = 2 (SEE BELOW), THE AUCs NOW WILL BE
C  RELATIVE TO TIME 0 IN THE "FUTURE", AS OPPOSED TO TIME 0 IN THE
C  "PAST".

C  THIS REQUIRES CHANGES IN THE CODE IN MAIN, AND IN SUBROUTINE 
C  WSUMSQ. IN EACH CASE, THE AUC AT TIME TNEXT (WHICH IS THE BEGINNING
C  TIME FOR THE "FUTURE") IS RESET BACK TO 0.

C  NOTE ALSO THAT TNEXT IS NOW INCLUDED IN COMMON/TOSUMSQ, SO THAT
C  IT CAN BE ADDED TO THE TIMES WHICH ARE ESTABLISHED BY ROUTINES
C  CALCTPRED AND CALCTPRED2.

C  NOTE THAT THIS PROGRAM IS NOW LINKED WITH CALCBST13.FOR, WHICH IS
C  UPDATED FROM CALCBST12.FOR.

C-----------------------------------------------------------------------

C  BESTDOS115.FOR                                          10/6/13

C  BESTDOS115 HAS THE FOLLOWING CHANGES TO BESTDOS114:

C  1. IN ADDITION TO USING CONCENTRATIONS (OBSERVED VALUES) AS TARGETS,
C  NOW THE USER WILL BE ABLE TO TARGET AUCs ALSO.

C  THIS WILL REQUIRE A NEW INPUT VALUE, ITARGET. IF ITARGET = 1, THE
C  TARGETS WILL BE CONCENTRATIONS, AS THEY HAVE BEEN IN PREVIOUS 
C  PROGRAMS. IF ITARGET = 2, THE TARGETS WILL BE AUCs. NOTE THAT EVEN IF
C  THE TARGETS ARE AUCs, THESE VALUES WILL STILL BE READ IN BY THE 
C  PROGRAM IN THE SAME LOCATIONS (AS IF THEY WERE CONCENTRATIONS IN THE
C  PATIENT DATA FILE).

C  BECAUSE THE INSTRUCTION FILE WILL HAVE THE ADDITIONAL ITARGET ENTRY,
C  IT WILL ALSO HAVE A NEW CODE, BESTDOS OCT_13.

C  2. THERE WILL BE EXTENSIVE CHANGES IN SUBROUTINES CALCS AND WSUMSQ
C  IN CALCBST12.FOR (UPDATED FROM CALCBST11.FOR). ALSO, THIS MODULE
C  HAS NEW SUBOUTINES CALCTPRED2 AND PUTORDER2.

C  3. NOTE THAT ARRAYS WEIGHT, PREDMIN2, DENSITY2, AND DOSEBEST2
C  HAVE BEEN REMOVED. WEIGHT WAS NOT NEEDED AFTER BESTDOS114.FOR,
C  AND THE OTHER 3 ARRAYS WERE NEVER NEEDED.

C  4. TO MAKE DIMENSIONS CONSISTENT, ALL 24000'S HAVE BEEN CHANGED TO
C  72000'S. AND ALL 71281'S HAVE BEEN CHANGED TO 72000 ALSO (THIS HAS
C  ALSO BEEN DONE IN CALCBST12.FOR). SIMILARLY, ALL 7200'S HAVE BEEN
C  CHANGED TO 72000'S. THE REASON TO LIMIT NUMT IN CALCTPRED TO 7200
C  WAS A HOLDOVER FROM THE npageng24.f PROGRAM, AND IS NOT APPLICABLE
C  IN THIS PROGRAM.

C  5. THIS PROGRAM IS NOW LINKED WITH IDM3X141.FOR, UPDATED FROM

C  DM3X14.FOR. THE DIFFERENCE IS THAT THE NEW MODULE HAS ALL ITS
C  71281 DIMENSIONS CHANGED TO 72000, TO BE COMPATIBLE WITH CHANGE
C  4. ABOVE.

C  6. NOTE THAT XLAM HAS BEEN MOVED IN FRONT OF THE INTEGER ARGUMENTS
C  IN COMMON/TOCALC TO AVOID A WARNING WHEN THIS PROGRAM IS COMPILED
C  WITH gfortran.

C-----------------------------------------------------------------------

C  BESTDOS114.FOR                                          9/27/13


C  BESTDOS114 HAS THE FOLLOWING CHANGES TO BESTDOS113:

C  1. IT WILL NOW BE COMPILED WITH CALCBST11.FOR, UPDATED FROM 
C  CALCBST10.FOR. THE MAIN CHANGE IN SUBROUTINE CALCS IS THAT THE
C  COST FUNCTION WILL NOW INVOLVE THE OLD COST FUNCTION (MEAN SQUARED
C  ERROR), PLUS A NEW BIAS TERM. THESE TWO TERMS WILL BE WEIGHTED BY
C  XLAM (USER SPECIFIED) WHICH WILL MULTIPLY THE BIAS TERM (AND 1-XLAM)
C  WILL MULTIPLY THE MEAN SQUARED ERROR TERM.

C  NOTE THAT SINCE THE USER NOW ENTERS XLAM, THERE WILL BE A NEW
C  INSTRUCTION FILE, WITH A NEW CODE, BESTDOS SEP_13. AND NOTE THAT
C  XLAM IS PROVIDED TO SUBROUTINE CALCS VIA COMMON/TOCALC.

C  NOTE THAT BOTH TERMS IN THE COST FUNCTION ARE NOW ALSO WRITTEN INTO
C  DOSEROUTxxxx.

C  2. THE MEAN SQUARED ERROR TERM WILL HAVE WEIGHT(.,.) REMOVED FROM
C  IT. I.E., COST FUNCTION WILL NO LONGER BE A FUNCTION OF THE ASSAY
C  COEFFICIENTS. SO WEIGHT IS NOW REMOVED FROM COMMON/TOCALC.

C  3. INSTEAD OF CALCULATING THE WEIGHTED MEAN OF THE GRID PTS. AND
C  CALCULATING THE Y's AND AUC's FOR THAT SINGLE GRID PT., AS THE LAST
C  PART TO BE PUT INTO DOSEROUTxxxx, NOW THE WEIGHTED MEAN OF THE
C  Y's AND AUC's OVER ALL THE GRID PTS. WILL BE PUT INTO DOSEROUTxxxx.
C  THIS IS MORE CONSISTENT WITH THE BIAS TERM CALCULATED IN SUBROUTINE
C  CALCS.

C-----------------------------------------------------------------------

C  BESTDOS113.FOR                                          8/26/13 

C  BESTDOS113 COMBINES THE CHANGE OF BESTDOS112A WITH THE ORIGINAL
C  BESTDOS112. IN PARTICULAR, THIS PROGRAM WILL CALL SUBROUTINE ELDERY
C  TWICE, ONCE WITH ALL THE POSTERIOR GRID PTS. HAVING EQUAL 
C  PROBABILITY (AS IN BESTDOS112), AND ONCE WITH THE POSTERIOR GRID PTS.
C  HAVING THEIR VALUES FROM THE 0-CYCLE RUN IN NPAGFULL1. THEN, THE
C  ELDERY CALL WHICH PRODUCES THE MIN SUM OF SQUARES WILL BE USED TO
C  ESTABLISH THE BEST DOSES.

C  REF: SEE THE EXAMPLE WITH MODEL3.FOR (COMMENTS UNDER 9.) IN
C  \ALAN3\BAYARD\SIMSTUDY\SIMSTUDY.EXP.

C-----------------------------------------------------------------------


C  BESTDOS112A.FOR                                         8/18/13

C  BESTDOS112A HAS ONE CHANGE TO BESTDOS112. AFTER THE RETURN FROM
C  SUBROUTINE NPAGFULL, CORDEN(.,NVAR+1) IS NOT RESET. IT WILL NOW
C  RETAIN ITS VALUE FROM WHAT IT WAS ON RETURN FROM NPAGFULL1. THE
C  REASON IS THAT THE DENSITY VALUES FROM NPAGFULL1 ACCURATELY REFLECT
C  HOW IMPORTANT EACH DAUGHTER PT. SHOULD BE IN THE CALL TO ELDERY
C  (THE WAY IT WAS DONE IN BESTDOS112.FOR, ALL THE GRID PTS. ENDED
C  UP WITH EQUAL PROBABILITY).

C-----------------------------------------------------------------------

C  BESTDOS112.FOR                                         8/6/13

C  BESTDOS112 HAS THE FOLLOWING CHANGES TO BESTDOS111.

C  IT HAS AN EXTENDED PROCESS TO OBTAIN THE POSTERIOR DENSITY TO MAKE IT
C  MORE LIKELY THAT THERE WILL BE MORE THAN 1 PT. IN IT. INSTEAD OF
C  JUST CALLING NPAGFULL, WHICH ALWAYS RETURNS THE SINGLE BEST POINT
C  WHICH IS COMPATIBLE WITH THE "PAST", THIS PROGRAM DOES A 2-STEP
C  PROCESS:

C  1. IT CALLS NPAGFULL11, WHICH RETURNS ALL GRID PTS. FROM THE 
C  ORIGINAL PRIOR DENSITY WHICH ARE ARE REASONABLY COMPATIBLE WITH THE
C  "PAST" (I.E., THOSE WHOSE PROBABILITIES ARE WITHIN 1.D-100 OF THE
C  BEST GRID PT.).

C  2. FOR EACH OF THE GRID PTS. IN 1., IT CALLS NPAGFULL TO OBTAIN
C  THE SINGLE DAUGHTER PT. WHICH IS BEST. 

C  THE RESULT THEN WILL BE A POSTERIOR CONSISTING OF THE BEST DAUGHTER
C  POINT FOR EVERY GRID PT. WHICH SHOWED UP IN STEP 1.

C-----------------------------------------------------------------------

C  BESTDOS111.FOR                                          5/23/13

C  BESTDOS111 HAS THE FOLLOWING CHANGES TO BESTDOS110:

C  1. IT GIVES THE USER THE OPTION OF NOT CALCULATING THE BEST DOSES
C  TO MINIMIZE THE EXPECTED WEIGHTED SUM OF SQUARES OF DIFFERENCES
C  BETWEEN OBSERVED AND TARGET CONCENTRATIONS, AND INSTEAD SIMPLY USING
C  THE DOSES INCLUDED IN THE "FUTURE" FILE. I.E., WHEN ELDERY IS CALLED,
C  THE DOSES IN THE "FUTURE" FILE ARE INITIAL GUESSES FOR THE DOSES TO 
C  BE USED BY ELDERY IN ITS OPTIMIZATION. BUT IF THE STEP(.) VALUES ARE
C  SET = 0, THERE WILL BE NO OPTIMIZATION, AND THE STARTING DOSES WILL
C  BE THE DESIRED DOSES TO BE USED.

C  2. ADDITONAL INFORMATION IS ADDED TO THE DOSEROUTxxxx OUTPUT FILE.
C  THE PARAMETER VALUES FOR EACH OF THE GRID POINTS USED FOR THE
C  CALCULATION OF THE OBSERVED VALUES IS NOW INCLUDED.`

C  3. IN SUBROUTINE AFTERCOMMA, OPEN(57) IS REPLACED BY 
C  OPEN(57, FILE='FILE57JUNK'). THE REASON IS THAT WHEN THIS PROGRAM IS
C  COMPILED/LINKED  WITH gfortran, IT RANDOMLY PRODUCES AN ERROR RELATED
C  TO BEING UNABLE TO OPEN FILE 57. OPENING 57 AS A NAMED FILE MAY

C  REDUCE OR ELIMINATE THIS ERROR.


C-----------------------------------------------------------------------

C  BESTDOS110.FOR                                          5/14/13

C  BESTDOS110 HAS ONE CHANGE FROM BESTDOS109. IN BESTDOS109, THE BLOCK

C  OF PREDICTED (SIMULATED) VALUES AND AUCs INCLUDED ALL THE DOSE
C  AND OBSERVATION TIMES THAT WERE IN BOTHFILES.ZPJ (IF THERE WAS A 
C  "PAST" HISTORY), OR THE DOSE AND OBSERVATION TIMES IN THE "FUTURE"
C  IF THERE WAS NO PAST HISTORY. EITHER WAY, THE OBSERVATION TIMES OF
C  THE "PAST" WERE NOT INCLUDED. IN BESTDOS110, HOWEVER, THE 
C  OBSERVATION TIMES FROM THE "PAST" WILL ALSO BE INCLUDED IN THE 
C  SIMULATED VALUES. THIS REQUIRED CHANGES IN MAIN, MAKETMP, AND
C  CALCTPRED, WHERE VALUES FOR M41 (AND TIM41(.)) ARE NOW SHARED.

C-----------------------------------------------------------------------

C  BESTDOS109.FOR                                          5/12/13

C  BESTDOS109 HAS THE FOLLOWING CHANGE TO BESTDOS108:

C  IN EACH BLOCK OF PREDICTED VALUES AND AUCs WHICH ARE WRITTEN TO THE
C  OUTPUT FILE, DOSEROUTxxxx, EXTRA LINES OF DATA ARE ADDED AS NEEDED TO
C  MAKE SURE THAT THE TIMES INCLUDE ALL OBSERVATION TIMES AND ALL DOSE
C  TIMES. LOTS OF CODE CHANGES ARE MADE IN SUBROUTINE CALCTPRED, AND
C  IN MAIN WHERE THESE VALUES ARE WRITTEN TO THE OUTPUT FILE.

C  NOTE THAT ALL THE CODE RELATED TO STEADY STATE DOSE SETS, AND TIME
C  RESETS HAS NOW BEEN REMOVED FROM THIS PROGRAM.


C-----------------------------------------------------------------------

C  BESTDOS108.FOR                                          4/24/13

C  BESTDOS108 HAS THE FOLLOWING CHANGES TO BESTDOS107:

C  1. CORDLAST IS DIMENSIONED AS AN ARRAY IN THIS MODULE. SINCE IT IS AN
C  ARGUMENT TO NPAGFULL, WHERE IT IS DIMENSIONED, IT SHOULD ALSO BE
C  DIMENSIONED IN THIS MODULE. SINCE NO INFORMATION IS PASSED BETWEEN
C  THE TWO MODULES (IT IS ONLY PASSED AS AN ARGUMENT SO IT CAN BE
C  VARIABLY DIMENSIONED0, THIS OVERSIGHT DID NOT CAUSE A PROBLEM WHEN
C  THIS PROGRAM WAS COMPILED/LINKED BY LAHEY FORTRAN; BUT IT DOES CAUSE
C  A PROBLEM WHEN gfortran COMPILES/LINKS THIS PROGRAM.

C  2. TWO CALLS TO READBLOCK2 IN SUBROUTINE VERIF1 HAVE BEEN CHANGED TO
C  HAVE ARGS. OF C0P,...,C3P, RATHER THAN C0,...,C3 BECAUSE THESE 
C  ARGUMENTS ARE SUPPOSED TO BE ARRAYS. THE ACTUAL VALUES SUPPLIED TO
C  READBLOCK2 AT THIS POINT ARE UNIMPORTANT, BUT MAKING THE ARGUMENTS
C  ARRAYS REMOVES A WARNING WHEN THIS PROGRAM IS COMPILED BY gfortran.

C  3. TWO CALLS TO STACK IN MAIN USE TMPFILE AS AN ARGUMENT, BUT TMPFILE
C  IS *13 RATHER THAN *20, WHICH IS THE SIZE OF THE RECEIVING ARGUMENT.

C  SO PATFIL*20 IS ADDED TO THIS MAIN MODULE, SET = TMPFILE BEFORE THE
C  CALLS TO STACK, AND REPLACES TMPFILE AS THE ARGUMENT IN THE CALLS TO
C  SUBROUTINE STACK.

C-----------------------------------------------------------------------

C  BESTDOS107.FOR                                          4/7/13

C  BESTDOS107 HAS THE FOLLOWING CHANGES FROM BESTDOS106:

C  THE OUTPUT FILE WILL INCLUDE MORE INFORMATION. FOR EACH GRID PT.
C  IN THE PARAMETER DENSITY, NOT ONLY WILL ALL THE TARGET OBSERVATIONS
C  BE WRITTEN (AS IN PREVIOUS PROGRAMS), BUT ALSO ALL OBSERVATIONS WILL
C  BE WRITTEN EVERY IDELTA MINUTES (IDELTA = 15 BY DEFAULT, BUT CAN BE
C  CHANGED BY THE USER); AND THE SAME APPLIES TO AUCs. AND, THESE SAME
C  VALUES WILL BE WRITTEN FOR THE WEIGHTED MEAN OVER ALL THE GRID POINTS
C  IN THE PARAMETER DENSITY.

C  THIS MEANS THAT idm3x14.f WILL NOW BE LINKED TO THIS PROGRAM SO THAT
C  SUBROUTINE IDCALCYY AN BE CALLED JUST AS IT IS IN npageng22.f TO
C  FIND PREDICTED VALUES IDELTA MINUTES APART.

C  NOTE THAT FORMAT 1416 IN MAIN IS ADDED TO WARN THE USER THAT THIS
C  PROGRAM IS NOT COMPATIBLE WITH STEADY STATE DOSE SETS OR TIME
C  RESETS.

C-----------------------------------------------------------------------

C  BESTDOS106.FOR                                          3/26/13

C  BESTDOS106 HAS THE FOLLOWING CHANGES FROM BESTDOS105:

C  1. RATHER THAN BEING LINKED WITH NPAGBAY.FOR, IT WILL BE LINKED WITH
C  NPAGFULL.FOR. THE DIFFERENCE IN THE TWO ROUTINES IS THAT, GIVEN THE
C  INPUT DENSITY IN NPAGDENFILE, NPAGBAY CALCULATES THE 0-CYCLE 
C  BAYESIAN POSTERIOR OF A SUBJECT, WHEREAS NPAGFULL CALCULATES THE FULL
C  POSTERIOR OF THE SUBJECT, UP TO A MAXIMUM OF MAXCYC CYCLES.

C  NOTE THAT IN ADDITION TO NPAGFULL.FOR, THIS PROGRAM WILL BE LINKED
C  WITH BLASNPAG.FOR (WHICH IS NEEDED BY NPAGFULL.FOR) ... AND SEE 
C  OTHER MODULES BELOW.

C  2. THIS PROGRAM HAS BEEN BROUGHT UP TO THE LEVEL OF THE OTHER 
C  POPULATION PROGRAMS (CURRENTLY NPAG110.FOR/npageng22.f AND
C  IT2B108.FOR/it2beng22.f), EXCEPT IT STILL DOES NOT ACCOMMODATE
C  STEADY STATE DOSES.

C  IN PARTICULAR THIS PROGRAM WILL BE LINKED WITH IDM1X14.FOR, RATHER
C  THAN IDM1X6.FOR, SHIFT9.FOR, RATHER THAN SHIFT6.FOR; AND

C  CALCBST10.FOR, RATHER THAN CALCBST9.FOR.


C  NOTE THAT USERS SHOULD START USING TSTMULTK.FOR RATHER THAN 
C  TSTMULTI.FOR. SEVERAL FORMATS IN THE PROGRAM IN MAIN AND VERIF1
C  NOW REFER TO TSTMULTK.FOR RATHER THAN TSTMULTI.FOR.

C  ALSO ALL DIMENSIONS OF 500 RELATED TO DOSES HAVE BEEN CHANGED TO
C  5000.

C  3. A BUG IS CORRECTED IN SUBROUTINE CSVCHANGE. PREVIOUSLY, IF A .CSV
C  FILE HAD AN IDEVENT = 4 WITH IADDL > 0 (I.E., REPEATED DOSES STARTING

C  WITH A DOSE RESET EVENT), CSVCHANGE WOULD IMPROPERLY WRITE IADDL
C  REPEATED DOSE LINES TO FILE 66 ALL WITH IDEVENT = 4. IN FACT, THESE
C  REPEATED LINES MUST, OF COURSE, HAVE IDEVENT = 1 (SINCE THEY ARE
C  REGULAR DOSE LINES, NOT MORE DOSE RESET LINES).



C  SUMMARY: THIS PROGRAM WILL BE LINKED WITH NPAGFULL.FOR, BLASNPAG.FOR,

C  BESTDOS105.FOR                                          3/2/13

C  BESTDOS105 HAS THE FOLLOWING CHANGES FROM BESTDOS104:

C  IN BESTDOS104, IPRIOR WAS 1 (WHICH MEANS THAT THE USER HAD A .MM
C  FILE TO BE USED DIRECTLY AS THE DENSITY FOR THE OPTIMIZATION) OR
C  IPRIOR = 0 (WHICH MEANS THAT THE USER STARTED WITH A JOINT DENSITY 
C  FROM A PREVIOUS NPAG RUN, DENxxxx, ALONG WITH A FILE GIVING INFO
C  FROM A SUBJECT'S PAST, PASTFILEIN; AND THEN SUBROUTINE NPAGBAY WOULD
C  BE CALLED TO OBTAIN THE BAYESIAN POSTERIOR OF THE NEW PATIENT, WHICH
C  IS THEN THE DENSITY FOR THE OPTIMIZATION). SEE BESTDOS101.FOR NOTES.
C  IN EITHER CASE, THE PROGRAM WOULD THEN OPTIMIZE THE DOSES TO GIVE
C  THE OBSERVED VALUES (AS CLOSELY AS POSSIBLE) IN THE FILE,
C  FUTUREFILEIN.

C  IN BESTDOS105, IPRIOR WILL NO LONGER BE USED BECAUSE THERE WILL NO
C  LONGER BE AN IPRIOR = 1 OPTION (I.E., THE USER WILL NEVER START WITH 
C  A DENSITY READY TO USE FOR THE OPTIMIZATION; INSTEAD HE WILL ALWAYS
C  START WITH A DENxxxx FILE FROM AN NPAG RUN ON A POPULATION). BUT WHAT
C  WAS THE OLD IPRIOR = 0 OPTION, WILL BE CHANGED AND EXPANDED TO ALLOW
C  THE FOLLOWING 3 CASES:

C  a. THE USER WILL HAVE A "PAST" FILE (PASTFILEIN) AND IT WILL CONTAIN
C     DOSES AND OBSERVATIONS FROM THE PATIENT'S PAST.
C  b. THE USER WILL HAVE A "PAST" FILE (PASTFILEIN) BUT IT WILL ONLY
C     CONTAIN DOSES (I.E., NO OBSERVATIONS) FROM THE PATIENT'S PAST.
C  c. THE USER WILL NOT HAVE A "PAST" FILE (PASTFILEIN). NOTE THAT IN
C     THIS CASE, INCLUDPAST (A NEW PARAMETER) WILL BE 0.

C  IN CASE a., THE PROGRAM WILL RUN SIMILARLY TO BESTDOS104 - IT WILL
C  USE SUBROUTINE NPAGBAY TO OBTAIN THE BAYESIAN POSTERIOR DENSITY FOR
C  THE PATIENT BASED ON DENxxxx AND PASTFILEIN, AND THIS DENSITY WILL
C  BE THE ONE USED FOR THE OPTIMIZATION. IN CASES b. AND c., DENxxxx
C  WILL NOT BE UPDATED (SINCE THERE ARE NO "PAST" OBSERVATIONS FOR THE
C  PATIENT), BUT WILL ITSELF BE THE DENSITY USED FOR THE OPTIMIZATION.

C  NOTE THAT IN CASE c., THE LOGIC WILL PROCEED SIMILAR TO THE 

C  IPRIOR = 1 CODE IN BESTDOS104; I.E., THE DENSITY TO BE USED FOR THE
C  OPTIMIZATION WILL BE READ FROM DENxxxx AND THEN THE OPTIMIZATION WILL
C  TAKE PLACE OVER THE DOSES IN FUTUREFILEIN (USING THE OBSERVED VALUES
C  IN FUTUREFILEIN AS TARGETS). BUT IN CASES a. AND b., THE LOGIC WILL
C  BE DIFFERENT THAN THAT FOR IPRIOR = 0 IN BESTDOS104. NOW, THE FILE
C  IN FUTUREFILEIN IS CONCATENATED AT THE END OF THE "PAST" FILE, 
C  PASTFILEIN (ACTUALLY ONLY THE DOSES, NOT THE OBSERVED VALUES OF
C  PASTFILEIN ARE NEEDED), WITH ALL ITS TIMES INCREASED BY "TNEXT" HOURS
C  (TNEXT IS A NEW VALUE WHICH IS INPUT TO THE RUN IN THE INSTRUCTION
C  FILE OR BY KEYBOARD ENTRY). THEN THE OPTIMUM DOSES IN THE "FUTURE"
C  ARE FOUND TO GIVE THE OBSERVED VALUES IN THE "FUTURE", BUT GIVEN THAT
C  THE "PAST" DOSES IN PASTFILEIN OCCURRED FIRST. I.E., WITH IPRIOR = 0
C  IN BESDOS104, IT WAS ASSUMED THAT ALL THE COMPARTMENT AMOUNTS STARTED
C  AT 0 (OR WERE GIVEN BY SUBROUTINE GETIX) WHEN FUTUREFILEIN WAS 
C  OPTIMIZED OVER TO GIVE THE BEST DOSES. NOW, THE COMP. AMOUNTS AT THE
C  START OF THE "FUTURE" WILL BE WHATEVER THE PROGRAM SIMULATES THEM TO
C  BE AT THE TIME, TNEXT. NOTE THAT THE PROGRAM WILL KNOW TO OPTIMIZE 
C  ONLY OVER THE DOSES IN THE "FUTURE" OF THE PATIENT, TO GIVE THE
C  OBSERVED VALUES IN THE "FUTURE" ... USING THE DOSES WHICH WERE IN THE

C  "PAST" AS GIVEN VALUES.

C  ALSO, SINCE THE INFORMATION IN THE INSTRUCTION FILE HAS BEEN CHANGED,
C  THE NEW CODE FOR A SAVED INSTRUCTION FILE WILL BE BESTDOS MAR_13, AND
C  NO PREVIOUS VERSIONS OF THE INSTRUCTION FILE WILL BE ALLOWED (I.E.,
C  IT WILL NOW ALWAYS BE ASSUMED THAT THE USER STARTS WITH AN 
C  NPAGDENFILE (DENSITY FROM AN NPAG RUN), WHICH MAY OR MAY NOT BE 
C  UPDATED (DEPENDING ON THE VALUES OF INCLUDPAST AND IPRIOROBS) AND 
C  WILL NEVER HAVE A MATLAB TYPE FILE (THE OLD IPRIOR = 1 OPTION) WITH
C  DENSITY VALUES.

C  NOTE THAT I HAD TO INCLUDE MAXOBDIM AS A CALLING ARGUMENT TO VERIF1
C  SINCE IT MUST PROVIDE THIS DIMENSION TO SUBROUTINE INSPECTOBS.



C  NOTE THAT THE FOLLOWING TWO CHANGES ARE NOT IN THIS PROGRAM, BUT WILL
C  BE PUT INTO THE NEXT VERSION OF THIS PROGRAM

C  - THE OUTPUT FILE WILL INCLUDE MORE INFORMATION. FOR EACH GRID
C    PT. IN THE PARAMETER DENSITY, NOT ONLY WILL ALL THE TARGET
C    OBSERVATIONS BE WRITTEN (AS IN PREVIOUS PROGRAMS), BUT ALSO ALL 
C    OBSERVATIONS WILL BE WRITTEN EVERY IDELTA MINUTES (IDELTA = 15 BY
C    DEFAULT, BUT CAN BE CHANGED BY THE USER); AND THE SAME APPLIES TO
C    AUCs (SINCE TIME 0 AND SINCE THE LAST DOSE).  AND, THESE SAME 
C    VALUES WILL BE WRITTEN FOR THE WEIGHTED MEAN OVER ALL THE GRID
C    POINTS IN THE PARAMETER DENSITY.

C  - AT THE END OF THE RUN, THE USER WILL SEE WHAT THE FUTURE OPTIMUM
C    DOSES ARE, AND THEN BE ABLE TO CHANGE THEM AND SEE WHAT THE 

C    RESULTING OBSERVED VALUES AND AUCs IN THE FUTURE WOULD BE.

C  BESTDOS104.FOR                                          2/17/13

C  BESTDOS104 HAS THE FOLLOWING CHANGES TO BESTDOS103A:

C  THIS VERSION OPTIMIZES OVER ALL DOSES, BOLUSES AS WELL AS IV'S. 
C  BESTDO103 ASSUMED THAT THE BOLUSES WERE FIXED AT THE VALUES IN THE
C  PATIENT'S DOSAGE REGIMEN, AND THE OPTIMIZATION WAS TO TAKE PLACE ONLY
C  OVER THE IV'S. BUT BESTDOS104 OPTIMIZES OVER ALL DOSES.

C  THE REQUIRED CHANGES ARE MADE IN MAIN AND FILRED (AND NOTE THAT
C  SIG HAS BEEN ADDED AS A CALLING ARGUMENT TO FILRED) OF THIS MODULE,
C  AND IN CALCBST8.FOR, UPDATED FROM CALCBST7.FOR.

C  AND NOTE THAT THE FORMAT OF HOW THE BEST DOSES ARE WRITTEN TO
C  DOSEROUTxxxx IS CHANGED.

C-----------------------------------------------------------------------

C  BESTDOS103A.FOR                                         2/10/13

C  BESTDOS103A HAS THE FOLLOWING CHANGES FROM BESTDOS103:

C  CAUTION: THIS PROGRAM DOES ALLOW THE NEW .CSV FORMAT AS DESCRIBED
C  BELOW. BUT THIS IS ONLY TO ALLOW IT TO BE RUN WITH PATIENTS WHICH
C  HAVE THEIR INFO IN THIS FORMAT, BUT DO NOT ACTUALLY HAVE STEADY STATE 
C  DOSES. THOSE PATIENTS WHICH HAVE STEADY STATE DOSE SETS WILL NOT
C  BE RUNNABLE WITH THIS PROGRAM SINCE NEWER CODE IS REQUIRED IN THE
C  NPAGBAY.FOR, SHIFT6.FOR, AND IDM1X6.FOR MODULES (THESE MODULES WERE
C  ALL COMPLETELY BEFORE 6/15/11, AND THE STEADY STATE DOSE SETS WERE
C  PUT INTO THE POPULATION PROGRAM STARTING WITH NPAG104.FOR, WHICH
C  IS DATED 1/18/12.

C  SO IF THE USER TRIES TO USE A PATIENT WITH ADDL > 0 OR -1, THE 
C  PROGRAM WILL PRINT A MESSAGE AND STOP (SEE FORMAT 321 IN
C  SUBROUTINE CSVCHANGE). 

C  1. IT ALLOWS A NEW VERSION OF THE .csv FILE. THIS FILE WILL HAVE
C  THE CODE,"POPDATA DEC_11" AT THE TOP, RATHER THAN "POPDATA APR_11".
C  THIS NEW .csv FILE WILL HAVE TWO EXTRA COLUMNS, ADDL AND II, WHICH
C  ALLOW THE USER TO SPECIFY THAT THE CURRENT DOSE LINE IS TO BE
C  REPLICATED ADDL TIMES AT AN INTERDOSE INTERVAL OF II. IF ADDL IS
C  MISSING, IT IS ASSUMED TO BE 0 (WHICH MEANS THE LINE IS NOT TO BE
C  REPLICATED). IF ADDL = -1, IT INDICATES A STEADY STATE DOSE SET IS 
C  BEGINNING WITH THAT LINE.

C  TO HANDLE THE NEW .csv FILE, A NEW SUBROUTINE, CSVCHANGE, WILL BE
C  CALLED (AFTER SUBROUTINE NEWCSV IS CALLED AND BEFORE READBLOCK IS
C  CALLED) TO CHANGE THE NEW .csv FILE INTO THE CORRESPONDING ONE
C  WITH THE OLD FORMAT. THIS WILL MINIMIZE THE CHANGES TO SUBROUTINE
C  READBLOCK, WHICH WILL STILL NEED TO BE CHANGED TO DEAL WITH 
C  NEGATIVE DOSE TIMES (WHICH WILL NOW INDICATE THE BEGINNING OF A 
C  STEADY STATE DOSE SET) - SEE CODE IN READBLOCK.

C  ALSO NOTE THAT CSVCHANGE CONVERTS SCRATCH FILE 67 TO SCRATCH FILE
C  66, WHICH MEANS THAT ALL THE READ(67,..) STATEMENTS IN READBLOCK ARE
C  NOW CHANGED TO READ(66,...) STATEMENTS. SIMILARLY, THE READ(67,...)
C  IN SUBROUTINE GETMAXTIM IS CHANGED TO READ(66,...).

C  SOME NOTES REGARDING THE NEW .csv FORMAT:

C  a. THE COLUMNS WILL NOW BE:
C  ID,EVID,TIME,DUR,DOSE,ADDL,II,INPUT,OUT,OUTEQ,C0,C1,C2,C3,Covs if any

C  b. ADDL AND II ARE ONLY RELEVANT FOR EVID=1 AND EVID=4. FOR EVID=0,
C  (OBSERVATIONS) THEY ARE IGNORED.

C  c. ADDL CONTAINS THE NO. OF ADDITIONAL DOSES TO GIVE, AT THE 
C  INTERDOSE INTERVAL OF II.

C  d. If ADDL IS MISSING FOR AN EVID=1 OR EVID=4 EVENT, IT IS ASSUMED 
C  TO BE 0 --> NO ADDITIONAL DOSES ARE GIVE. IN THIS CASE, II IS
C  IRRELEVANT.

C  e. IF ADDL > 0, THEN ADDL ADDITIONAL DOSES ARE GIVEN (I.E., A TOTAL
C  OF ADDL + 1) AT INTERVAL II. A MISSING II IN THIS CASE WILL RESULT
C  IN THE PROGRAM STOPPING WITH AN ERROR MESSAGE TO THE USER.

C  f. ADDL > 0 CAN OCCUR ON ANY DOSE EVENT, BUT ADDL = -1 (A STEADY
C  STATE DOSE INDICATOR) CAN ONLY OCCUR AT T = 0 AT THE BEGINNING OF
C  A PATIENT'S FILE, OR AT A DOSE RESET TIME.

C  2. IN SUBROUTINE TIMESET, THE FIRST TIME IN THE DOSAGE BLOCK FOR EACH
C  SUBJECT IS NO LONGER TESTED TO MAKE SURE IT IS 0. THE REASON, OF
C  COURSE, IS THAT NOW THE FIRST TIME MAY BE NEGATIVE (WHICH SIGNIFIES
C  THAT THE DOSAGE REGIMEN BEGINS WITH A STEADY STATE OF DOSES).

C  3. A NEW SUBROUTINE CONVERTCSV IS CALLED BEFORE EACH CALL TO
C  SUBROUTINE NEWCSV TO CONVERT, IF NECESSARY, A "EUROPEAN" VERSION OF
C  A .CSV FILE TO THE FORM READBLOCK EXPECTS. IN THE "EURO" VERSION, THE
C  FIELD SEPARATORS ARE SEMICOLONS, RATHER THAN COMMAS, AND THE 
C  CHARACTER USED TO SEPARATE THE WHOLE PART OF A NUMBER FROM THE
C  FRACTIONAL PART IS A COMMA, RATHER THAN A PERIOD. TO DO THIS REQUIRES
C  READING THE SECONDS LINE OF THE .CSV FILE (THE FIRST LINE HAS THE
C  VERSION CODE) AND CHECKING FOR SEMICOLONS. IF THERE ARE ANY, THEN THE
C  FILE IS CHANGED SO THAT, IN ORDER, ALL COMMAS ARE CHANGED TO PERIODS,
C  AND THEN ALL SEMICOLONS ARE CHANGED TO COMMAS. NOTE THAT, EVEN IN THE
C  "EURO" VERSION, IT WILL STILL BE ASSUMED THAT A DOT REPRESENTS
C  A MISSING (OR UNNEEDED) VALUE.

C  NOTE THAT BLOCKPAT IS NOW OPENED AS SCRATCH FILE 87. THEN CONVERTCSV
C  WRITES THIS FILE AS THE CORRECTED VERSION TO SCRATCH FILE 77. THEN,
C  ROUTINE NEWCSV CONVERTS THIS FILE TO SCRATCH FILE 67. THEN ROUTINE
C  CSVCHANGE CONVERTS THIS FILE TO SCRATCH FILE 66, WHICH IS READ BY
C  ROUTINE READBLOCK.

C  BESTDOS103.FOR                                          8/15/11

C  BESTDOS103 HAS THE FOLLOWING CHANGES TO BESTDOS102:

C  1. THE ACTIVE (SALT) FRACTION, AF, WILL NOW BE A VECTOR. PREVIOUSLY,
C  IT WAS ASSUMED THAT ALL DRUGS HAD THE SAME AF; NOW EACH DRUG WILL
C  HAVE ITS OWN.

C  THE ABOVE CHANGE MEANS THAT THE NEW VERSION OF THE INSTRUCTION FILE
C  (OR 'GUICMDS.INX' IF IT EXISTS IN THE WORKING DIRECTORY) WILL HAVE
C  A NEW CODE, 'BESTDOS SEP_11', AND BE ACCOMPANIED BY A NEW ICODE = 4.
C  THEN AS THE INSTRUCTIONS ARE BEING READ IN, IF ICODE = 4, THE PROGRAM
C  WILL KNOW TO READ IN AF(I),I=1,NDRUG, RATHER THAN JUST AF. THIS ALSO
C  REQUIRES CHANGES WHERE INSTRUCTION FILE IS BEING SAVED FOR A 

C  SUBSEQUENT RUN.

C  NOTE THAT IN OLDER INSTRUCTION FILES, ALL AF(I), I=1,NDRUG, WILL
C  BE SET = THE INPUT VALUE OF AF (NOW CALLED AFSCALAR).

C  NOTE THAT THE OUTPUT FILE WILL ALSO NOW HAVE AF(I),I=1,NDRUG WRITTEN
C  TO IT, RATHER THAN JUST AF.


C  NOTE THAT SUBROUTINE GETNUMEQ HAS BEEN EXPANDED TO ALSO OBTAIN THE
C  NO. OF DRUGS, NDRUG, SINCE THIS VALUE IS NEEDED BEFORE 
C  AF(I),I=1,NDRUG ARE READ VIA THE KEYBOARD. ALSO GETNUMEQ IS NOW 
C  CALLED BEFORE VERIFI1 IS CALLED TO OBTAIN NDRUG SO THAT IF ONLY
C  AFSCALAR WAS READ IN (I.E., IN AN OLDER INSTRUCTION FILE), ALL THE
C  AF(I),I=1,NDRUG CAN BE SET = AFSCALAR.

C  2. CODE IN SUBROUTINE STACK IS CHANGED WHERE THE RS(.,.) VALUES ARE
C  MULTIPLIED (NOW) BY AF(.).

C-----------------------------------------------------------------------

C  BESTDOS102.FOR                                          6/22/11

C  BESTDOS102 HAS THE FOLLOWING CHANGES TO BESTDOS101:

C  1. SUBROUTINE GETERRGAM IS REMOVED BECAUSE IERRMOD AND GAMLAM ARE
C  NOW INPUT FROM THE USER VIA THE INSTRUCTION FILE OR KEYBOARD, ALONG
C  WITH OTHER INPUT INFO.

C  NOTE THAT I CORRECTED A SUBTLE BUG IN THE CODE REGARDING GAMLAM0,
C  THOUGH THIS BUG REMAINS FOR NOW IN THE NPAG100 PROGRAM (IF MAXCYC
C  = 0). TECHNICALLY, WHEN THE BAYESIAN DENSITY FOR A SET OF SUBJECTS
C  IS FOUND FROM A PRIOR DENSITY, AND IERRMOD .GE. 2, THE VALUE OF
C  GAMLAM USED SHOULD BE THE FINAL ESTIMATE AT THE END OF THE 
C  PRIOR RUN, NOT THE INITIAL ESTIMATE WITH WHICH THE NPAG RUN
C  STARTED. FOR EXAMPLE, IF IERRMOD = 2 AND GAMLAM0 = 1, BUT THE FINAL
C  ESTIMATE FOR GAMMA = 5, IT MEANS THAT THE ASSAY C'S USED WOULD HAVE
C  BEEN BETTER IF THEY HAD BEEN MULTIPLIED BY 5 FROM THEIR ORIGINAL
C  VALUES. AND THIS INFORMATION SHOULD BE USED GOING FORWARD WHEN

C  GETTING THE BAYESIAN POSTERIORS FOR A NEW SET OF SUBJECTS. IN 
C  BESTDOS102, IT IS MADE CLEAR WHEN THE USER ENTERS GAMLAM, HE IS
C  ENTERING THE FINAL ESTIMATED VALUE FROM THE ORIGINAL NPAG RUN ON THE
C  ENTIRE POPULATION, NOT THE INITIAL ESTIMATE AS IS IMPLIED IN 
C  BESTDOS101. TO EMPHASIZE THIS, THE TERM USED IS GAMLAM, NOT GAMLAM0.


C  2. WHEN THE PROGRAM IS RUN, IT WILL FIRST SEARCH FOR THE FILE, 
C  'GUICMDS.INX' IN THE SAME DIRECTORY AS BESTDOS102.EXE. IF IT FINDS
C  THIS FILE, IT WILL OPEN IT AND READ IN ALL THE INPUT INSTRUCTIONS,
C  AND RUN WITH NO USER INTERACTION AT ALL. IF THE FILE DOES NOT EXIST,
C  THE PROGRAM WILL PROCEED AS BEFORE, ASKING THE USER TO INPUT 
C  INSTRUCTIONS VIA AN INSTRUCTION FILE OR THE KEYBOARD.

C  NOTE THAT IF 'GUICMDS.INX' EXISTS, THE FINAL ARGUMENT (WHICH IS NEW)
C  TO READBLOCK2 IS 1 (SEE CODE IN SUBROUTINE READBLOCK2 REGARDING IGUI
C  AND READING ICOVTYPE IN THAT CASE).

C  3. THE PATH IS NOW ALSO INCLUDED IN THE OUTPUT FILE.

C-----------------------------------------------------------------------

C  BESTDOS101.FOR                                          6/17/11

C  BESTDOS101 IS A MAJOR REVISION TO BESTDOS100. THIS NEW PROGRAM ALLOWS
C  AN ADDITIONAL LEVEL OF COMPLEXITY TO THE ANALYSIS. IN BESTDOS100, THE
C  USER ALREADY HAD AVAILABLE HIS PRIOR JOINT DENSITY FILE (SEE CODE FOR
C  MATFIL). 

C  IN BESTDOS101, HOWEVER, THE USER MAY NOT ALREADY HAVE THIS INFO. 
C  INSTEAD, HE MAY START WITH A JOINT DENSITY FROM AN NPAG RUN, ALONG 
C  WITH A "PAST HISTORY" FOR A NEW SUBJECT (EITHER A WORKING COPY FILE 
C  OR A .CSV FILE). IN THIS CASE, THE PROGRAM WILL CALL A SHORTENED
C  VERSION OF npagengxx.F (NPAGBAY) WHICH WILL OBTAIN THE BAYESIAN
C  POSTERIOR JOINT DENSITY OF THIS NEW SUBJECT ... WHICH WILL THEN BE
C  THE PRIOR JOINT DENSITY FILE FOR THE BEST DOSE CALCULATIONS.

C  NOTE THAT IN THIS LATTER CASE, THE NEW SUBJECT'S "PAST HISTORY" INFO

C  (I.E., THE DOSING REGIMEN AND OBSERVED VALUE TIMES AND LEVELS) MAY
C  BE DIFFERENT THAN THE REGIMEN OVER WHICH THE BEST DOSES WILL BE 
C  OBTAINED IN THE FUTURE. THIS MEANS THAT THE "FUTURE" INFO FOR THIS
C  NEW SUBJECT WILL HAVE TO BE ENTERED SEPARATELY FROM THE "PAST" INFO,
C  AND THIS MEANS THAT THE INSTRUCTION FILE WILL BE EXPANDED TO INCLUDE
C  THIS INFO. BECAUSE OF THIS, THE INSTRUCTION FILE WILL HAVE A NEW

C  CODE, BESTDOS JUL_11.

C  NOTE THAT VODTOT.FOR WILL NO LONGER BE LINKED INTO THIS PROGRAM
C  SEPARATELY. INSTEAD, THE MODULE NPAGBAY WILL CONTAIN A VERSION OF
C  VODTOT.FOR THAT HAS A FEW CHANGES TO BE COMPATIBLE WITH ANDREAS'
C  INTEL COMPILER.

C  NOTE ALSO THAT NPAGBAY REQUIRES SUBROUTINE SUBRES WHICH CALLS
C  SUBROUTINE IDPC, AND THIS MEANS THAT MODULE IDM1X6.FOR (THE SAME
C  AS idm1x6.f IN npageng13.f) WILL NOW BE LINKED TO THIS PROGRAM. 
C  BECAUSE OF THIS, AND THE FACT THAT IDM1X6.FOR HAS ROUTINES USERANAL

C  AND JACOB, CALCBST6.FOR WILL BE REPLACED BY CALCBST7.FOR, WHICH
C  DOES NOT HAVE THESE ROUTINES.

C  SO HERE ARE THE MAJOR STEPS OF THIS PROGRAM:



C  1. USER ENTERS A MODEL FILE WHICH IS ALREADY LINKED WITH THIS
C     PROGRAM.

C  2. USER SELECTS WHETHER HE ALREADY HAS PRIOR DENSITY (IPRIOR = 1
C     --> YES; IPRIOR = 0 --> NO).

C  3. IF IPRIOR = 1, THE PROGRAM USES THE SAME LOGIC AS IN
C     BESTDOS100.

C  4. IF IPRIOR = 0, USER ENTERS THE JOINT DENSITY FILE FROM A 
C     PREVIOUS NPAG RUN, ALONG WITH INFO WITH ANOTHER SUBJECT'S "PAST"
C     DATA (VIA EITHER A WORKING COPY FILE OR .CSV FILE).

C     THEN NEW SUBROUTINE NPAGBAY (BASED ON THE CODE IN npageng13.f 
C     WHEN MAXCYC = 0) IS CALLED TO OBTAIN THE BAYESIAN POSTERIOR OF
C     THE NEW PATIENT; THIS IS THE PRIOR DENSITY USER WOULD HAVE
C     ENTERED DIRECTLY IN STEP 2 IF IPRIOR WAS = 1.

C-----------------------------------------------------------------------

C  BESTDOS100.FOR                                          6/4/11

C  BESTDOS100 HAS THE FOLLOWING CHANGES FROM BESTDOS8:

C  1. IT IS BROUGHT TO THE LEVEL OF THE OTHER '100' PROGRAMS, NPAG100, 
C  IT2B100, AND MONT100.FOR. IN PARTICULAR, NEW SUBROUTINES READBLOCK2,
C  ETC. ARE ADDED SO THAT THE DOSE REGIMEN, AND OBSERVED VALUE BLOCK 
C  CAN BE INPUT VIA A .CSV FILE, RATHER THAN A WORKING COPY FILE. THE
C  FORMAT OF THIS .CSV FILE WILL BE THE UPDATED ONE REFERRED TO IN THE
C  COMMENTS AT THE TOP OF THE OTHER '100' PROGRAMS SPECIFIED ABOVE.


C  2. WT AND CCR ARE NO LONGER TREATED AS SPECIAL COVARIATES. SO
C  ALL OCCURRENCES OF 2 + NADD WILL NOW BE REPLACED BY NADD. THIS ALSO
C  MEANS THAT THE MODEL FILE MUST NOW BE AN EDITED VERSION OF THE  
C  TEMPLATE MODEL FILE, TSTMULTI.FOR (UPDATED FROM TSTMULTH.FOR. 

C  3. SHIFT5.FOR WILL BE REPLACED BY SHIFT6.FOR (SAME AS SHIFT6.F IN
C  npageng13.f PROGRAM), WHICH IS REQUIRED FOR THE CHANGES RELATED TO
C  WT AND CCR NO LONGER BEING CONSIDERED SPECIAL COVARIATES. NOTE THAT
C  THE OTHER MODULES, CALCBST6.FOR AND VODTOT.FOR, ARE UNCHANGED.


C  4. THERE WILL BE A NEW CODE FOR THE INSTRUCTION FILE, 
C  'TESTDOS JUN_11', AND ALL PREVIOUS VERSIONS OF INSTRUCTION FILES WILL
C  NO LONGER BE ALLOWED. THE MAIN DIFFERENCES ARE THAT MORE INFO WILL BE
C  STORED (INCLUDING THE MODEL FILENAME, THE O.D.E. TOLERANCES, AND THE
C  NAME OF THE FILE WHICH HAS THE APRIORI DENSITY), AND THE FILE WILL
C  ALSO HAVE TEXT DESCRIBING WHAT INFO IS INPUT.

C  5. THE OUTPUT FILE WILL NO LONGER BE HARDCODED TO BE TAR_ACH.CON.
C  INSTEAD IT WILL BE DOSEROUTxxxx, WHERE xxxx WILL BE READ FROM
C  FILE EXTNUM. AND THE TOP OF THE OUTPUT FILE WILL BE A RESTATEMENT
C  OF ALL INSTRUCTIONS AS USUAL BEFORE THE OUTPUT VALUES WILL BE 
C  WRITTEN.

C  6. A NEW FLAG, CALLED IPRINTOUT, IS HARDCODED TO BE 1, WHICH MEANS
C  THAT THE OUTPUT INFO (SEE FORMAT 1234 IN SUBROUTINE ELDERY) IS 
C  PRINTED TO THE SCREEN AS USUAL. THIS IS DONE IN ANTICIPATION OF THIS
C  PROGRAM BEING RUN AS AN "ENGINE" CALLED BY ANDREAS' GUI. IN THAT
C  CASE, IPRINTOUT CAN BE RESET = 0, WHICH WILL SUPPRESS THE INFO IN

C  FORMAT 1234 FROM BEING WRITTEN TO THE SCREEN.


C  7. ALL THE PAUSE STATEMENTS ARE NOW CHANGED TO CALL PAUSE STATEMENTS,
C  AND NEW SUBROUTINE PAUSE IS ADDED TO THE PROGRAM. THIS IS DONE SINCE
C  A REGULAR PAUSE STATEMENT CAUSES WARNINGS WHEN THIS PROGRAM IS 
C  COMPILED AND LINKED USING gfortran (AND FORCES THE USER TO TYPE "go"
C  INSTEAD OF SIMPLY HITTING THE ENTER KEY).

C-----------------------------------------------------------------------

C  BESTDOS8.FOR                                            1/27/11

C  BESTDOS8 HAS THE FOLLOWING CHANGES FROM BESTDOS7:

C  1. FORMATS 919 AND 5001 ARE CHANGED TO EXPLAIN TO THE USER THAT HIS
C  FORTRAN MODEL FILE, LINKED INTO THIS PROGRAM, MUST BE AN EDITED
C  VERSION OF TSTMULTH.FOR. THE PREVIOUS LANGUAGE WAS OUTDATED (SINCE
C  THE BOXES PROGRAM HAS NOT BEEN UP TO DATE FOR A LONG TIME).


C  2. IT IS COMPILED WITH CALCBST6.FOR, RATHER THAN CALCBST5.FOR, AND
C  A MODEL FILE BASED ON TSTMULTH.FOR, RATHER THAN TSTMULTG.FOR. THE 
C  OTHER PERMANENT MODULES, SHIFT5.FOR, VODTOT.FOR, ARE UNCHANGED. 

C  NOTE THAT IN CALCBST6.FOR, THE CHANGES ARE IN SUBROUTINE GETPRED,
C  AND, IN ADDITION TO CORRECTING A COUPLE OF BUGS, MAKE THIS PROGRAM
C  COMPATIBLE WITH TSTMULTH.FOR, AS INDICATED ABOVE.

C  3. THE CALL TO SUBROUTINE DETECT IS COMMENTED OUT. THE REASON IS
C  THAT IT WILL NOW BE ASSUMED THAT THE USER CREATES HIS MODEL FILE 
C  FROM THE TEMPLATE MODEL FILE (CURRENTLY TSTMULTH.FOR) AND SO IT 
C  WILL AUTOMATICALLY HAVE THE CORRECT DECLARATION STATEMENTS AT THE
C  TOP OF EACH SUBROUTINE. PLUS, THIS WILL PREVENT THIS PROGRAM FROM
C  STRIPPING AWAY SPECIAL DECLARATION STATEMENTS THE USER MAY NEED TO
C  ADD TO THE ROUTINES FOR SPECIAL CASE ANALYSES.

C  NOTE THAT SUBROUTINE DETECT, AND THE ROUTINES IT CALLS, WILL BE LEFT
C  IN THE CODE FOR NOW (IN CASE THEY, OR MODIFIED VERSIONS OF THEM ARE
C  NEEDED IN A FUTURE VERSION OF THIS PROGRAM).

C-----------------------------------------------------------------------

C  BESTDOS7.FOR							10/15/09

C  BESTDOS7 IS A MAJOR ENHANCEMENT TO BESTDOS6, AS FOLLOWS:

C  1. BESTDOS6 IS LIMITED TO ONE OUPUT EQUATION AND ONE DRUG; BESTDOS7
C  ALLOWS MULTIPLE OUTPUTS AND MULTIPLE DRUGS ... TO THE LEVEL OF THE
C  MULTIPLE DRUG BIG NPAG PROGRAM, NPBIG15C.FOR/bigmlt4.f.

C  2. SEVERAL SUBROUTINES IN THIS PROGRAM ARE NOW REPLACED BY THE 
C  CORRESPONDING VERSIONS FROM THE CURRENT BIG NPAG POPULATION PROGRAM, 
C  NPBIG15C.FOR, OR ARE MODIFICATIONS OF ROUTINES FROM NPBIG15C.FOR, BUT 
C  ADJUSTED TO FIT THE CODE OF THIS PROGRAM. THESE ROUTINES INCLUDE:
C  GETPATH, FULLNAME, PUTASS, FILRED, STACK, USERPREP, CHECKLIN, 
C  WRITEDIF, WRITESYM, WRITEOUT, AND SKIPLINE. SOME OF THE CHANGED CODE

C  IS MINOR (E.G., *72 BECOMES *1000); OTHER IS MAJOR.

C  NOTE THAT IN SUBROUTINE PUTASS, SUBROUTINE USECS IS NO LONGER NEEDED,
C  AND SO SUBROUTINE USECS IS REMOVED FROM THE PROGRAM.

C  NOTE THAT A VERSION OF SUBROUTINE GETNUMEQ FROM NPBIG15C.FOR IS

C  ADDED TO THIS PROGRAM (IT IS CALLED BY MAIN).

C  3. NOTE THAT THIS PROGRAM WILL REQUIRE A NEW CODE FOR THE INSTRUCTION
C  FILE (TESTDOS NOV_09) SINCE THE INPUT INFO WILL BE DIFFERENT FROM
C  THAT OF THE PREVIOUS PROGRAM.


C  4. NOTE THAT THE FORMAT FOR THE PATIENT DATA FILE WILL NOW HAVE TO BE
C  THE MULTIPLE DRUG WORKING COPY FORMAT. I.E., NO BLOCK FORMAT WILL BE
C  ALLOWED (UNLIKE IN NPBIG15C.FOR, THE POPULATION PROGRAM).

C  5. THIS MODULE IS LINKED WITH CALCBST5.FOR, WHICH IS AN UPDATE FROM

C  CALCBST4.FOR.

C  6. THIS MODULE WILL BE LINKED WITH SHIFT5.F, RATHER THAN SHIFT2.F,
C  SINCE THE TEMPLATE MODEL FILE IS NOW CHANGED TO BE TSTMULTG.FOR
C  (SEE DETAILS IN NPBIG15C.FOR).

C  7. THIS PROGRAM NO LONGER LINKS IN CONVRTLO.FOR. IT IS UNNEEDED.

C-----------------------------------------------------------------------

C  BESTDOS6.FOR							3/1/08

C  BESTDOS6 HAS THE FOLLOWING CHANGES TO BESTDOS5:

C  1. IN SUBROUTINE PUTASS, AT LABEL 25, THE FREE FORMAT WRITING
C     LINE  ... 25   WRITE(27,*) 'ASSAY COEFFICIENTS FOLLOW:'
C     IS REPLACED BY A FIXED FORMAT. THIS PREVENTS EXTRA COMMAS
C     BEING WRITTEN TO THE LINE WITH SOME COMPILERS.

C  2. THIS MODULE IS LINKED WITH CALCBST4 CONVRTLO SHIFT2 VODTOT

C     AND THE USER-SUPPLIED MODEL FILE. ALL THE ROUTINES ARE THE SAME
C     AS IN BESTDOS5, EXCEPT CALCBST4, WHICH IS CHANGED FROM CALCBST3
C     (DOSES ARE PREVENTED FROM BEING NEGATIVE IN SUBROUTINE CALCS.

C-----------------------------------------------------------------------

C  BESTDOS5.FOR							9-8-03

C  BESTDOS5 HAS THE FOLLOWING CHANGE FROM BESTDOS4:


C  THE BEST SET OF DOSES TO MINIMIZE THE EXPECTED WEIGHTED SUM OF 
C  SQUARES OF DIFFERENCES BETWEEN OBSERVED AND TARGET CONCENTRATIONS,
C  AS WELL AS THE THIS SUM OF SQUARES, AS CALCULATED BY THE CALL TO 

C  SUBROUTINE ELDERY, ARE ALSO PUT INTO THE OUTPUT FILE, TAR_ACH.CON 
C  (PREVIOUSLY THEY WERE JUST WRITTEN TO THE SCREEN).

C-----------------------------------------------------------------------


C  BESTDOS4.FOR							01-05-03

C  BESTDOS4 IS A MAJOR VARIATION OF BESTDOS3. THE MAJOR CHANGE IS THAT
C  THIS PROGRAM NOW ALLOWS GENERAL MODELS WHICH CAN BE DESCRIBED BY
C  DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS AND OUTPUT EQUATION(S) CODED BY THE USER
C  INTO SUBROUTINES DIFFEQ AND OUTPUT OF FILE, npemdriv.f. I.E., THE

C  MODEL IS NO LONGER LIMITED TO THE STANDARD 3-COMPARTMENT LINEAR
C  MODEL.

C  BESTDOS4 WILL BE COMPILED AND LINKED WITH CALCBST3, CONVRTLO, 
C  SHIFT2.F, VODTOT.F, AND npemdriv.f (WHICH THE USER EDITS AND 

C  COMPLETES - npemdriv.f WILL THEN BE RENAMED SOMETHING WITH A
C  .FOR EXTENSION).

C  THE CODING CHANGES REQUIRED ARE AS FOLLOWS:


C  1. THE I/O IS CHANGED TO BE LIKE THE OTHER "BIG" PROGRAMS (BIG NPAG

C  AND BIG IT2B), WHICH DON'T HAVE MENUS. IN PARTICULAR, THIS PROGRAM
C  IS ESSENTIALLY AT THE "LEVEL" OF NPBIG10B.FOR, WHICH MEANS THAT
C  ONLY A SINGLE DRUG IS ALLOWED. HOWEVER, FOR NOW, ONLY ONE OUTPUT
C  EQUATION IS ALLOWED (I.E., NPBIG10B ALLOWS MULTIPLE OUTPUT EQUATIONS

C  BUT THIS PROGRAM IS LIMITED TO JUST ONE).

C  2. THIS PROGRAM IS LINKED WITH CALCBST3.FOR (UPDATED FROM 
C  CALCBST2.FOR).

C  3. NEW COMMON/FROMBEST PROVIDES THE VALUES NEEDED BY CALCBST3.FOR
C  WHEN IT CALLS NEW SUBROUTINE MAKEVEC.


C  4. SUBROUTINE GETCOVAR IS NO LONGER NEEDED SINCE THE USER CODES
C  DIRECTLY INTO SUBROUTINES DIFFEQ, OUTPUT, AND SYMBOL WHICH 
C  DESCRIPTORS ARE TO BE USED. 

C  5. ALL DIMENSIONS OF 150 ARE CHANGED TO 594 - TO MAKE THESE
C  DIMENSIONS CONSISTENT THROUGHOUT THE PROGRAM. ALSO, THE DIMENSIONS
C  FOR PAR AND PARFIX ARE CHANGED TO BE THE SAME AS IN NPBIG10B.FOR.
C  IDES(16), NIND(29), AND DESCR(26)*20 ARE REMOVED. IRAN(25) IS ADDED,
C  AS IS FORFILE*20.

C  6. REMOVED COMMON/TOPAR SINCE IT IS NOW NOT APPLICABLE (I.E., IT
C  PASSES TO MODULE PARADP17.FOR INFO FOR MENUS 1 AND 2 IN THE 
C  3-COMPARTMENT LINEAR MODEL). NOTE THAT PARADP17.FOR IS NO LONGER
C  LINKED WITH THIS PROGRAM.

C  7. NEW I/O WHICH IS SIMILAR TO THAT IN NPBIG10B.FOR IS USED. IN
C  PARTICULAR, ALL REFERENCES TO MENUS, NPAR, NFIX ARE REMOVED. BUT
C  I/O FOR THE O.D.E. TOLERANCES ARE INCLUDED.

C  8. ALL REFERENCES TO SUBROUTINES PARNAM AND PARNAM2 ARE ELIMINATED.

C  9. IN NPBIG10B.FOR, GETNUMEQ IS CALLED TO GET NUMEQT, THE NO. OF

C  OUTPUT EQS. IN THIS PROGRAM, WE WILL ASSUME FOR NOW THAT NUMEQT
C  =1, SO GETNUMEQ IS NOT INCLUDED IN THIS PROGRAM.

C 10. SUBROUTINES DETECT, CHECKLIN, SKIPLINE, WRITEDIF, WRITEOUT, AND
C  WRITESYM ARE INCLUDED (FROM NPBIG10B.FOR), BUT IVERS IS HARDCODED
C  = 0 (SINCE IT WILL BE ASSUMED THAT ONLY THE BETA VERSION IS
C  AVAILABLE FOR NOW).

C 11. SUBROUTINE USERPREP IS ADDED (FROM NPBIG10B.FOR).

C 12. NBI IS REMOVED AS AN ARGUMENT TO SUBROUTINE STACK.

C 13. SUBROUTINE FILRED IS CHANGED TO BE LIKE THAT IN MODULE,
C  bignpaglap1.f (THE .f FILE WHICH IS COMPATIBLE WITH NPBIG10B.FOR).
C  IN PARTICULAR, TIM AND YO DIMENSIONS WILL CHANGE TO (594) AND 
C  (594,6), RESPECTIVELY; COMMON/DESCR IS BE INCLUDED; AND NTLAG IS NOW
C  A PART OF COMMON/CNST. ALSO, AGE, ISEX, HEIGHT, AND IETHFLG ARE
C  REMOVED FROM THE ARGUMENT LIST (SINCE COMMON/TOPAR IS N/A).

C 14. SUBROUTINES PRINTMENU, GETIND, AND PRINTCOV ARE REMOVED.

C 15. THE IKAMS1/IKAMS2 LOGIC TO CHECK ON COMPATIBILITY BETWEEN BOLUS 
C  INPUTS AND KA IS REMOVED SINCE WITHOUT INDICES, THERE IS NO WAY TO 
C  KNOW IF KA IS A PARAMETER.

C 16. THE CODE FOR A SAVED INSTRUCTION FILE HAS BEEN CHANGED TO
C  'TESTDOS NOV_02'.

C 17. THE MAXIMUM NO. OF GRID POINTS WHICH CAN BE USED (I.E., THE NO.
C  OF GRID POINTS READ IN FROM THE MATLAB FILE BY BESTDOS4.FOR) IS
C  CURRENTLY SET = MAXGRD = 5003.

C 18. IN SUBROUTINE ELDERY, A NEW WRITE STATEMENT (SEE FORMAT 1234) IS
C  PUT IN TO GIVE USER SOME INDICATION OF HOW CLOSE TO CONVERGENCE THE
C  PROGRAM IS.

C-----------------------------------------------------------------------

C  BESTDOS3.FOR							6-19-02

C  BESTDOS3 IS THE SAME AS BESTDOS2 EXCEPT THAT THE LIMITATION ON THE
C  MAXIMUM NO. OF DOSES (SEE FORMAT 103) HAS BEEN RESET TO 500 WHICH
C  IS CORRECT (I.E., THE ONLY LIMITATION IS THE SIZE OF THE START
C  AND STEP VECTORS IN THIS ROUTINE, AND SIMILAR ARRAYS IN OTHER
C  ROUTINES - NOT THE ARBITRARY VALUE OF 7). NOTE THAT MAXDIM = 7
C  MEANS THAT THE MAXIMUM NO. OF MODEL PARAMETER IS 7, BUT THIS IS

C  UNRELATED TO THE MAXIMUM NO. OF DOSES ALLOWED.

C  ALSO NOTE THAT A NEW PARAMETER STATEMENT IN SUBROUTINE ELDERY IS
C  NEEDED TO RESET THE DIMENSIONS OF THOSE ARRAYS WHICH ARE NOT 

C  CALLING ARGUMENTS AND THEREFORE CANNOT HAVE THEIR DIMENSIONS SET
C  BY THE PASSED PARAMETER N.

C-----------------------------------------------------------------------


C  BESTDOS2.FOR							9-29-01

C  BESTDOS2 IS A SLIGHT EXTENSION TO BESTDOSE. THE DIFFERENCE IS THAT,
C  FOR EACH GRID POINT IN THE INPUT DENSITY, THE ACHIEVED CONCENTRATIONS
C  FOR THE CURRENT BEST SET OF DOSES (I.E., THOSE GIVING THE MINIMUM
C  EXPSUM IN SUBROUTINE CALCS, CALLED BY ELDERY) ARE STORED IN 
C  COMMON/PREDVAL. THESE VALUES WILL BE STORED INTO THE FILE
C  TAR_ACH.CON BEFORE THIS PROGRAM CLOSES.

C-----------------------------------------------------------------------

C  BESTDOSE.FOR							8-24-01

C  BESTDOSE IS A MAJOR EXTENSION TO TESTDOSE. TESTDOSE CALCULATED A

C  SINGLE EXPECTED WEIGHTED SUM OF SQUARES (SEE BELOW) FOR A
C  HARDCODED SET OF DOSE VALUES AND WEIGHTS (THE TARGET CONCENTRAIONS
C  WERE THOSE READ AS OBSERVED VALUES FROM A PATIENT DATA FILE). 
C  BESTDOSE CALLS ELDERY (WHICH USES THE NELDER MEED ALGORITHM) TO FIND 
C  THE BEST SET OF DOSES TO MINIMIZE THIS EXPECTED WEIGHTED SUM OF 
C  SQUARES, GIVEN:
C   1. A PATIENT DATA FILE WITH THE REQUIRED DOSE TIMES, OBSERVATION 
C      TIMES, AND TARGET CONCENTRATIONS (= OBSERVED VALUES), AND


C   2. A PRIOR DENSITY FILE WITH PARAMETER VALUES AND CORRESPONDING
C      DENSITIES.

C  BESTDOSE IS COMPILED AND LINKED WITH CALCBEST, PARADP17, CONVRTLO

C??? ACTUALLY MAXDIM IS UNRELATED TO MAX. NO. OF DOSES. SEE COMMENTS
C    AT TOP OF BESTDOS3.FOR.
C  FOR NOW, BESTDOSE.FOR (AUGUST, 2001), THE MAX. NO. OF DOSES IS
C  LIMITED TO 7. TO RAISE IT, WILL HAVE TO INCREASE THE DIMENSIONS IN
C  SUBROUTINE ELDERY, AND INCREASE MAXDIM IN THE THREE PARAMETER 
C  STATEMENTS IN CALCBEST.FOR.

C-----------------------------------------------------------------------

C  TESTDOSE.FOR							1-26-01


C  TESTDOSE IS A VARIATION OF TESTDRV2. TESTDRV2 CALCULATED THE 
C  EXPECTED VALUE OF THE FISHER INFORMATION MATRIX, GIVEN A CANDIDATE
C  VECTOR OF OBSERVATION TIMES (AND A PATIENT DATA FILE WITH THE DOSAGE
C  REGIMEN, AND A PRIOR DENSITY FILE).



C  TESTDOSE CALCULATES THE EXPECTED WEIGHTED SUM OF SQUARES OF
C  DIFFERENCES BETWEEN OBSERVED AND TARGET CONCENTRATIONS, GIVEN A
C  CANDIDATE VECTOR OF DOSE AMOUNTS (DOSE TIMES AND OBSERVATION TIMES
C  AND TARGET CONCENTRATIONS ARE GIVEN IN A PATIENT DATA FILE; ALSO A
C  PRIOR DENSITY FILE IS GIVEN).

C  THIS PROGRAM MUST BE COMPILED AND LINKED WITH CONVRTLO.FOR,
C  PARADP17.FOR, AND CALCS 

C-----------------------------------------------------------------------

C  PROCEDURE:

C  1. THIS PROGRAM WILL READ FROM THE USER, VIA THE KEYBOARD, OR AN
C  INPUT FILE, (NVAR,MENU,NPAR,NOFIX,NFIX,VALFIX,IDES,NCOV). THESE
C  VALUES, ALONG WITH AGE, HEIGHT, ISEX, IETHFLG FROM THE PATIENT DATA
C  FILE (SEE NO. 2 BELOW) WILL BE PASSED VIA COMMON/TOPAR TO THE PARDEF
C  ROUTINE (WHICH IS PART OF THE PARADP17 MODULE).

C  2. IT WILL THEN READ IN A PATIENT DATA FILE. IF IT IS A 
C  USC*PACK FILE, IT WILL BE CONVERTED TO A WORKING COPY FILE WITH

C  THE DESIRED ASSAY COEFFICIENTS IN IT. THIS FILE WILL BE PUT INTO 
C  FILE 27. THEN BEFORE CALCS IS CALLED, SUBROUTINE FILRED 

C  WILL BE CALLED. FILRED READS IN THE ASSAY COEFFICIENTS, ALONG WITH 
C  AGE, HEIGHT, ISEX, AND IETHFLG (SEE NO. 2 ABOVE) AND PUTS THE 
C  REQUIRED DOSAGE INFO INTO THE REQUIRED COMMONS (ALL THIS INFO IS 
C  NEEDED BY THE CALCS MODULE).

C  NOTE THAT FILRED WILL BE CALLED JUST ONCE TO ESTABLISH ALL THE VALUES
C  (DOSE TIMES, OBSERVATION TIMES, ETC.) INTO THE REQUIRED COMMONS.
C  THEN, EACH TIME A NEW DOSAGE CANDIDATE VECTOR IS USED, THE VALUES OF
C  THESE NEW DOSES WILL BE STORED INTO THE RS VECTOR IN COMMON/OBSER
C  BY SUBROUTINE WSUMSQ IN MODULE CALCS (I.E., FILRED WILL NOT HAVE
C  TO BE CALLED AGAIN SINCE ALL THE VALUES ALREADY STORED INTO ITS
C  COMMONS STAY THE SAME EXCEPT FOR THE RS VECTOR WHICH WILL BE STORED
C  AS INDICATED ABOVE).

C  SUBROUTINE CSVCHANGE IS CALLED BY MAIN AND SUBROUTINE GETNUMEQ TO
C  CHANGE .csv FILES WITH CODE OF POPDATA DEC_11 (I.E., THOSE WITH 2
C  EXTRA COLUMNS FOR ADDL AND II) TO EQUIVALENT .csv FILES WITH CODE OF
C  POPDATA APR_11 (THOSE WITHOUT THE TWO EXTRA COLUMNS). IT READS
C  FILE 67, AND WRITES THE INFORMATION TO SCRATCH FILE 66. NOTE THAT IF
C  THE .csv FILE READ IN ALREADY IS THE OLDER VERSION (WITH CODE 
C  POPDATA APR_11), THIS ROUTINE SIMPLY REWRITES IT TO FILE 66, WHICH IS
C  THEN READ BY SUBROUTINE READBLOCK.

C  THIS ROUTINE IS BASED ON THE STAND-A-LONE PROGRAM, CSVCHANGE.FOR.
C  AS OF IT2B104.FOR, THIS ROUTINE IS BASED ON CSVCHANGE2.FOR.

C  CSVCHANGE.FOR                                           12/6/11

C  THIS PROGRAM CONVERTS THE NEW-STYLE .csv FILES (WITH TWO ADDITIONAL
C  COLUMNS (ADDL AND II) TO THE PREVIOUS .csv FORMAT.

C  ADDL GIVES THE NO. OF ADDITIONAL DOSES FOR ANY DOSE EVENT, AND II
C  GIVES THE INTERDOSE INTERVAL FOR THE ADDITIONAL DOSES.

C  EX: IF TIME = 0, DUR = 2, DOSE = 1000, ADDL = 2, II = 12, THIS
C  PROGRAM WOULD PUT IN TWO EXTRA LINES AS FOLLOWS:

C  TIME    DUR    DOSE  ADDL  II    

C   0       2     1000   2    12  <-- ONLY LINE IN NEW-STYLE FILE
C  12       2     1000   <-- THESE TWO LINES ARE ADDED TO THE OLD
C  24       2     1000       STYLE FILE (WHICH DOESN'T HAVE ADDL AND
C                            II COLUMNS.

C  NOTE THAT ADDL = -1 IS A STEADY STATE DOSE INDICATOR. IN THIS CASE,
C  CHANGE THE TIME OF THE DOSE TO -II, SO SUBROUTINES READBLOCK/WRITEDOS
C  WILL RECOGNIZE THE LINE AS THE BEGINNING OF A STEADY STATE DOSE SET.

C  NOTE THAT ONCE ALL THE ADDITIONAL DOSES ARE ADDED TO THE DOSE
C  ARRAY, THEY MUST ALL BE ORDERED AMONG THEMSELVES (UNTIL THE NEXT
C  DOSE/TIME RESET) SINCE READBLOCK EXPECTS ORDERED DOSES. BUT IT IS
C  OK FOR ALL THE DOSES IN A GIVEN REGION TO COME FIRST, AND THEN ALL
C  THE OBSERVATIONS TO FOLLOW (I.E., THE DOSES SHOULD BE ORDERED AMONG
C  THEMSELVES AND THE OBSERVATIONS FOLLOW THE DOSES, ORDERED AMONG
C  THEMSELVES).

C  NOTE THAT ADDL AND II ENTRIES ARE IGNORED IF EVID = 0 (I.E.,THE
C  EVENT IS AN OBSERVATION).

C  NOTE THAT IF ADDL AND II ARE MISSING FOR A DOSE EVENT (EVID = 1 OR
C  4) THEN ADDL IS ASSUME TO BE 0 (NO ADDITIONAL DOSES) AND II IS
C  IRRELEVANT.

C??? EDITED COMMENTS BELOW. 7/4.
C  AS OF BESTDOS119.FOR, THE LOGIC OF CALCTPRED FROM BESTDOS108.FOR
C  IS PUT BACK INTO THIS ROUTINE. THAT LOGIC ALLOWED STEADY STATE
C  DOSE SETS (AND TIME RESETS, ALTHOUGH THERE WILL BE NO TIME RESETS
C  FOR THE TIME BEING AT LEAST). NOTE THERE CAN BE AT MOST 1 STEADY
C  STATE DOSE SET, AND IT HAS TO BE AT THE BEGINNING OF THE PATIENT
C  FILE IF IT OCCURS.

C  NOTE THAT THE LOGIC OF ADDING OBSERVATION AND DOSE TIMES TO THE
C  REGULAR PREDICTED TIMES (WHICH ARE IDELTA/60 HOURS APART) IS 
C  TEMPORARILY REMOVED ... IT CAN BE PUT BACK IN AFTER VERIFYING THAT
C  THE REGULAR PREDICTED TIMES GET PUT IN PROPERLY.


C  THIS ROUTINE IS CALLED BY MAIN TO CALCULATE THE NUMT TIMES TO BE 
C  PUT INTO TPRED. THESE WILL BE THE REGULAR PREDICTED
C  TIMES WHICH START AT 0, ARE IDELTA/60 HOURS APART, AND CONTINUE UNTIL
C  24 HOURS AFTER THE LAST OBSERVATION TIME, ALONG WITH ALL THE DOSE AND
C  ALL THE OBSERVATION TIMES (REDUNDANT TIMES WILL BE IGNORED OF 
C  COURSE). <-- FOR NOW SKIP THE DOSE AND OBSERVATION TIMES.

C  NOTE THAT THE REGULAR TIMES ARE TO BE IDELTA MINUTES APART, SUBJECT
C  TO THE CONSTRAINT THAT THE MAXIMUM NO. OF TIMES BE 72000.
C  BUT NOTE BELOW THAT THE TIMES IN TPRED ARE IN HOURS, NOT MINUTES.
C  AND NOTE IF A STEADY STATE DOSE SET OCCURS AT THE BEGINNING OF A 
C  PATIENT FILE (THE ONLY PLACE IT CAN OCCUR IN THIS PROGRAM), TIMES IN
C  TPRED WILL START AT THE END OF IT, RATHER THAN AT 0.

C  FOR EXAMPLE, IF THERE IS A STEADY STATE DOSE SET WITH INTERDOSE
C  INTERVAL = DOSEINT, THEN THE TIMES WILL START AT 100*DOSEINT
C  (SINCE EACH STEADY STATE DOSE SET IS ASSUMED TO HAVE 100 DOSES).
C  AS A SPECIFIC EXAMPLE, IF A STEADY STATE DOSE SET WITH INTERDOSE
C  INTERVAL OF 2 HOURS STARTS AT TIME 0 AND THE 1ST OBS. TIME IS AT
C  205, IT REALLY MEANS THAT THE OBSERVATIONS START 5 HOURS AFTER THE
C  END OF THE STEADY STATE DOSE SET. IN THIS CASE, THE TIMES IN TPRED
C  STILL START AT 200. 

C  BUT, ALSO ESTABLISH TPREDREL(.) WHICH IS SIMILAR
C  TO TPRED, BUT HAS "RELATIVE" INSTEAD OF "REAL" TIMES AFTER STEADY
C  STATE DOSES. IN THE EXAMPLE ABOVE WITH AN INTERDOSE INTERVAL OF 2 
C  HOURS, THE TPRED(.) VALUES START AT 200 AND THE TPREDREL(.) VALUES
C  START AT 0. AND EACH TPREDREL(I) = TPRED(I) - 200.

C  !!! AS OF BESTDOS119.FOR, TPRED VALUES WILL START AT 0 UNLESS THE
C  CORRESPONDING DOSES FOR THIS TIME BLOCK START WITH A STEADY STATE
C  SET. IN THAT CASE, THE TPRED VALUES WILL START FROM THE END OF THE
C  STEADY STATE SET. THE STARTING DOSE TIME IS IN SIG(1). IF
C  THIS VALUE IS < 0, IT REPRESENTS THE START OF A STEADY STATE DOSE
C  SET, WITH INTERDOSE INTERVAL = -SIG(1). OTHERWISE, SIG(1) SHOULD
C  BE 0 (I.E., IF THERE IS NO STEADY STATE SET).

C  NOTE THAT, AS INDICATED ABOVE, THE TPREDREL VALUES WILL ALWAYS START
C  AT 0.
  
      TBEG = 0.D0

C  THERE ARE NOBSER OBSERVATION TIMES IN TIM. SET TIMMAX TO THE LAST
C  ONE, WHICH IS THE LARGEST, AND THEN SET T_END = 24 HOURS AFTER
C  TIMMAX.

      TIMMAX = TIM(NOBSER)
      T_END = TIMMAX + 24.D0
     
C  PUT THE REGULAR TIMES IN TVECT; THEY START AT TBEG AND END AT T_END,
C  AND ARE IDELTA/60 HOURS APART. SO THERE WILL BE 
C  (T_END - TBEG)*60/IDELTA + 1 OF THEM. NOTE THAT IF 60/IDELTA IS NOT

*
*     op( A )*X = alpha*B,   or   X*op( A ) = alpha*B,
*
*  where alpha is a scalar, X and B are m by n matrices, A is a unit, or
*  non-unit,  upper or lower triangular matrix  and  op( A )  is one  of
*
*     op( A ) = A   or   op( A ) = A'.
*
*  The matrix X is overwritten on B.
*
*  Parameters
*  ==========
*
*  SIDE   - CHARACTER*1.
*           On entry, SIDE specifies whether op( A ) appears on the left
*           or right of X as follows:
*
*              SIDE = 'L' or 'l'   op( A )*X = alpha*B.
*
*              SIDE = 'R' or 'r'   X*op( A ) = alpha*B.
*
*           Unchanged on exit.
*
*  UPLO   - CHARACTER*1.
*           On entry, UPLO specifies whether the matrix A is an upper or
*           lower triangular matrix as follows:
*
*              UPLO = 'U' or 'u'   A is an upper triangular matrix.
*
*              UPLO = 'L' or 'l'   A is a lower triangular matrix.
*
*           Unchanged on exit.
*
*  TRANSA - CHARACTER*1.
*           On entry, TRANSA specifies the form of op( A ) to be used in
*           the matrix multiplication as follows:
*
*              TRANSA = 'N' or 'n'   op( A ) = A.
*
*              TRANSA = 'T' or 't'   op( A ) = A'.
*
*              TRANSA = 'C' or 'c'   op( A ) = A'.
*
*           Unchanged on exit.
*
*  DIAG   - CHARACTER*1.
*           On entry, DIAG specifies whether or not A is unit triangular
*           as follows:
*
*              DIAG = 'U' or 'u'   A is assumed to be unit triangular.
*
*              DIAG = 'N' or 'n'   A is not assumed to be unit
*                                  triangular.
*
*           Unchanged on exit.
*
*  M      - INTEGER.
*           On entry, M specifies the number of rows of B. M must be at
*           least zero.
*           Unchanged on exit.
*
*  N      - INTEGER.
*           On entry, N specifies the number of columns of B.  N must be
*           at least zero.
*           Unchanged on exit.
*
*  ALPHA  - DOUBLE PRECISION.
*           On entry,  ALPHA specifies the scalar  alpha. When  alpha is
*           zero then  A is not referenced and  B need not be set before
*           entry.
*           Unchanged on exit.
*
*  A      - DOUBLE PRECISION array of DIMENSION ( LDA, k ), where k is m
*           when  SIDE = 'L' or 'l'  and is  n  when  SIDE = 'R' or 'r'.
*           Before entry  with  UPLO = 'U' or 'u',  the  leading  k by k
*           upper triangular part of the array  A must contain the upper
*           triangular matrix  and the strictly lower triangular part of
*           A is not referenced.
*           Before entry  with  UPLO = 'L' or 'l',  the  leading  k by k
*           lower triangular part of the array  A must contain the lower
*           triangular matrix  and the strictly upper triangular part of
*           A is not referenced.
*           Note that when  DIAG = 'U' or 'u',  the diagonal elements of
*           A  are not referenced either,  but are assumed to be  unity.
*           Unchanged on exit.
*
*  LDA    - INTEGER.
*           On entry, LDA specifies the first dimension of A as declared
*           in the calling (sub) program.  When  SIDE = 'L' or 'l'  then
*           LDA  must be at least  max( 1, m ),  when  SIDE = 'R' or 'r'
*           then LDA must be at least max( 1, n ).
*           Unchanged on exit.
*
*  B      - DOUBLE PRECISION array of DIMENSION ( LDB, n ).
*           Before entry,  the leading  m by n part of the array  B must
*           contain  the  right-hand  side  matrix  B,  and  on exit  is
*           overwritten by the solution matrix  X.
*
*  LDB    - INTEGER.
*           On entry, LDB specifies the first dimension of B as declared
*           in  the  calling  (sub)  program.   LDB  must  be  at  least
*           max( 1, m ).

C  CALCBST15.FOR                                           7/7/14

C  CALCBST15 HAS THE FOLLOWING CHANGES FROM CALCBST14:

C  1. IF THE PROGRAM BOMBS, THE MESSAGE THAT IS WRITTEN TO THE SCREEN
C  WILL NOW ALSO BE WRITTEN TO THE FILE ERRFIL = ERRORxxxx, WHERE xxxx
C  IS THE 4-DIGIT RUN NO. IN THIS WAY, IF THE PROGRAM IS BEING RUN USING
C  Pmetrics, THE Pmetrics PROGRAM CAN RESPOND APPROPRIATELY. NOTE THAT
C  ERRFIL IS PASSED TO ALL THE ROUTINES WHICH COULD WRITE TO IT
C  USING COMMON/ERR/ERRFIL.

C  2. THE MAXIMUM NO. OF OUTPUT EQUATIONS WILL BE CHANGED FROM 6 TO 7,
C  AND TO FACILITATE ANY FUTURE SUCH CHANGES, THIS NUMBER WILL BE SET
C  = MAXNUMEQ (SO ONLY THE PARAMETER STATEMENT WILL HAVE TO BE CHANGED
C  IN THE FUTURE). RATHER THAN PASS MAXNUMEQ TO ALL THE RELEVANT 
C  SUBROUTINES (AS IS DONE IN NPAG113.FOR AND IT2B110.FOR), THIS 
C  PROGRAM WILL JUST HAVE MAXNUMEQ SET IN A PARAMETER STATEMENT IN ALL
C  THESE ROUTINES. AND NOTE THAT IN THOSE SUBROUTINES, ANY 6
C  REFERRING TO THE MAX. NO. OF OUTPUT EQUATIONS WILL BE CHANGED TO
C  MAXNUMEQ.

C  3. IN SUBROUTINE GETPRED, THE DIMENSIONS OF 6 IN XSTORE AND XPRED
C  HAVE BEEN CHANGED TO 20, AS THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN ALL ALONG (I.E.,
C  THIS REPRESENTS THE MAXIMUM NO. OF COMPARTMENTS ALLOWED).

C  4. THE TWO WRITE STATEMENTS TO FILE 25 ARE REMOVED, SINCE FILE 25 IS
C  NOT ACTIVE IN THIS PROGRAM.

C  5. IN SUBROUTINE GETPRED, COMMON/ERROR/ERRFIL IS ADDED; ERRFIL IS
C  DECLARED CHARACTER*20; AND FORMAT 111 AND SIG(.) ARE WRITTEN TO
C  ERRFIL JUST BEFORE THE PROGRAM STOPS IF THE PATIENT DATA FILE
C  HAS AN OBSERVATION TIME RESET ROW WITHOUT AN ACCOMPANYING DOSE
C  RESET ROW.

C  6. A BUG IS FIXED IN SUBROUTINE WSUMSQ.IN THE IF(ITARGET .EQ. 2)
C  PORTION OF THE CODE, AUC IS NO LONGER SET BACK TO 0 IF 
C  TPRED(I) = TNEXT ... SINCE AUCs ARE CUMULATIVE FROM TIME 0 IN THE
C  "PAST", AS OF BESTDOS118.FOR. THIS BUG EXISTED ONLY IN 
C  BESTDOS118.FOR, AND IS NOW FIXED IN BESTDOS119.FOR, WHICH IS THE
C  FIRST PROGRAM TO USE CALCBST15.FOR.

C-----------------------------------------------------------------------

C  CALCBST14.FOR                                           11/4/13

C  CALCBST14 HAS THE FOLLOWING CHANGE TO CALCBST13. "XLAM" IS REPLACED
C  BY "BIASWEIGHT". THIS IS DONE TO REMOVE ANY CONFUSION WITH LAMBDA,
C  WHICH IS A TERM USED IN THE ASSAY ERROR FUNCTION. 

C  CALCBST14.FOR IS A MODULE IN THE NEW BESTDOS117.FOR PROGRAM.

C-----------------------------------------------------------------------

C  CALCBST13.FOR                                           10/16/13

C  CALCBST13 HAS THE FOLLOWING CHANGES TO CALCBST12:

C  IF THE USER SELECTS ITARGET = 2 (SEE BELOW), THE AUCs NOW WILL BE
C  RELATIVE TO TIME 0 IN THE "FUTURE", AS OPPOSED TO TIME 0 IN THE
C  "PAST".

C  THIS REQUIRES CHANGES IN SUBROUTINE WSUMSQ. THE AUC AT TIME TNEXT
C  (WHICH IS THE BEGINNING TIME FOR THE "FUTURE") IS RESET BACK TO 0.

C  NOTE ALSO THAT TNEXT IS NOW INCLUDED IN COMMON/TOSUMSQ, SO THAT
C  IT CAN BE ADDED TO THE TIMES WHICH ARE ESTABLISHED BY ROUTINE
C  CALCTPRED2.

C  NOTE THAT THIS PROGRAM IS NOW LINKED WITH BESTDOS116.FOR.

C-----------------------------------------------------------------------

C  CALCBST12.FOR                                           10/6/13

C  CALCBST12 HAS THE FOLLOWING CHANGES FROM CALCBST11:

C  1. THERE ARE A NUMBER OF CHANGES IN SUBROUTINE WSUMSQ TO ALLOW FOR
C  THE NEW CASE THAT THE OBSERVED VALUES COULD BE TARGET AUCs, RATHER
C  THAN TARGET CONCENTRATIONS.

C  NOTE ALSO THAT THE NEW COMMON/TOSUMSQ PROVIDES INFO NEEDED BY
C  WSUMSQ FROM MAIN.

C  2. THE DIMENSION 71281 FOR YYPRED AND TPRED HAS BEEN CHANGED TO
C  72000 TO BE CONSISTENT WITH THTE DIMENSIONS NOW IN BESTDOS115.FOR.

C  3. NOTE THAT XLAM HAS BEEN MOVED IN FRONT OF THE INTEGER ARGUMENTS
C  IN COMMON/TOCALC TO AVOID A WARNING WHEN THIS PROGRAM IS COMPILED
C  WITH gfortran.

C  THIS MODULE IS PART OF THE NEW PROGRAM, BESTDOS115.FOR.

C-----------------------------------------------------------------------

C  CALCBST11.FOR                                           9/16/13

C  CALCBST11 HAS THE FOLLOWING CHANGES TO CALCBST10:

C  1. THE COST FUNCTION TO BE MINIMIZED IN SUBROUTINE CALCS IS CHANGED
C  TO NOW INCLUDE A BIAS TERM ALSO. THIS REQUIRES SEVERAL CHANGES IN
C  SUBROUTINES CALCS AND WSUMSQ. AND IT REQUIRES XLAM TO BE PROVIDED
C  TO CALCS VIA COMMON/TOCALC.

C  2. IN WHAT IS NOW THE FIRST PART OF THE COST FUNCTION, THE 
C  WEIGHT(.,.) ARRAY IS ELIMINATED. I.E., NOW THAT PART OF THE COST
C  FUNCTION WILL NO LONGER BE WEIGHTED BY THE ASSAY NOISE.

C  3. EXTRA/NEW VALUES ARE RETURNED TO MAIN VIA COMMON/PREDVAL. INSTEAD
C  OF JUST PREDMIN AND SUMM, NOW PREDMIN, EEXPSUMMIN, SUMMIN, AND 
C  BIASMIN ARE RETURNED.

C-----------------------------------------------------------------------

C  CALCBST10.FOR                                           3/26/13

C  CALCBST10 HAS THE FOLLOWING CHANGES FROM CALCBST9:

C  THE CODE IN CALCPRED/GETPRED IS NOW BASED IN idm1x14.f, RATHER THAN
C  idm1x6.f. THIS BRINGS THE BESTDOS106/CALCBST10 PROGRAM UP TO THE
C  LEVEL OF THE NPAG AND IT2B PROGRAMS, EXCEPT THAT THIS PROGRAM STILL
C  DOES NOT ACCOMMODATE STEADY STATE DOSE SETS --> THERE IS EXTRA UNUSED
C  CODE RELATED TO STEADY STATE DOSE SETS IN GETPRED (WHICH MAY BE USED
C  IN A LATER VERSION).

C  NOTE, IN PARTICULAR, THAT ALL DIMENSIONS OF 500 RELATED TO THE NO. OF
C  DOSES ARE NOW CHANGED TO 5000.

C-----------------------------------------------------------------------

C  CALCBST9.FOR                                            3/2/13

C  CALCBST9 HAS THE FOLLOWING CHANGES FROM CALCBST8:

C  1. COMMON/TOCALC, SUPPLIED TO SUBROUTINE CALCS, NOW INCLUDES AN
C  EXTRA ARGUMENT, NDD41, AND THIS ARGUMENT (WITH NAME CHANGED TO 
C  ND41) IS SUPPLIED TO SUBROUTINE WSUMSQ. IN THAT ROUTINE, IT IS USED
C  TO CHANGE THE DO I = 1,ND LOOP TO DO I = ND41+1,ND.

C  2. THIS MODULE IS A PART OF THE NEW PROGRAM, BESTDOS105.FOR.

C-----------------------------------------------------------------------

C  CALCBST8.FOR                                            2/13/13

C  CALCBST8 HAS THE FOLLOWING CHANGES FROM CALCBST7:

C  IT OPTIMIZES OVER ALL DOSES IN THE PATIENT FILE, BOLUSES AS WELL
C  AS IV RATES (CALCBST7 ASSUMED THAT THE BOLUSES WERE FIXED, AND ONLY
C  OPTIMIZED OVER THE IV RATES). CALCBST8 IS USED WITH THE NEW MAIN
C  PROGRAM, BESTDOS104.FOR.

C  NOTE THAT THE ONLY CHANGES REQUIRED ARE IN SUBROUTINE WSUMSQ.

C-----------------------------------------------------------------------

C  CALCBST7.FOR                                            6/17/11

C  CALCBST7 IS THE SAME AS CALCBST6 EXCEPT THAT ROUTINES USERANAL
C  AND JACOB HAVE BEEN REMOVED (SINCE THEY ARE NOW PROVIDED IN THE
C  NEW MODULE IDM1X6.FOR FOR THE BESTDOS101.FOR PROGRAM).

C-----------------------------------------------------------------------

C  CALCBST6.FOR                                            1/27/11

C  CALCBST6 HAS THE CHANGES FROM CALCBST5 (IN SUBROUTINE GETPRED) that
C  idm1x6.f HAS FROM idm1x3.f. THESE CHANGES, IN ADDITION TO CORRECTING
C  A COUPLE OF BUGS, MAKE THIS PROGRAM NOW COMPATIBLE WITH MODEL 
C  TEMPLATE FILE, TSTMULTH.FOR (UPDATED FROM TSTMULTG.FOR). THIS MODULE
C  IS LINKED FIRST WITH MAIN MODULE, BESTDOS8.FOR.

C-----------------------------------------------------------------------

C  CALCBST5.FOR							10/15/09

C  CALCBST5 HAS THE FOLLOWING CHANGES FROM CALCBST4:

C  1. IT IS A MODULE IN THE BESTDOS7.FOR PROGRAM. THIS PROGRAM IS 
C  AT THE "LEVEL" OF THE NPBIG15C.FOR PROGRAM. I.E., IT ALLOWS MULTIPLE
C  DRUGS AND MULTIPLE OUTPUTS.

C  2. CODE CHANGES, AND DIMENSION CHANGES OCCUR IN SUBROUTINES
C  WSUMSQ, CALCPRED, GETPRED, USERANAL (ONLY CHANGE IS THAT WARNING
C  STATEMENT IS SUPPRESSED) AND MAKEVEC.

C  NOTE THAT THE MODEL FILE CONSISTENT WITH THIS PROGRAM IS NOW
C  TSTMULTG.FOR. NOTE ALSO, THAT THE SHIFT MODULE COMPILED AND
C  LINKED WITH THIS PROGRAM IS NOW SHIFT5.F.

C-----------------------------------------------------------------------

C  CALCBST4.FOR							3/1/08

C  CALCBST4 HAS THE FOLLOWING CHANGES FROM CALCBST3:

C  1. IN SUBROUTINE CALCS, ANY CANDIDATE VECTOR OF DOSES WHICH INCLUDES
C     A NEGATIVE VALUE IS IMMEDIATELY REJECTED BY RETURNING A LARGE
C     (UNATTRACTIVE) VALUE FOR THE OBJECTIVE FUNCTION, EXPSUM. THIS
C     REQUIREMENT SHOULD HAVE BEEN IN PLACE ALL ALONG.

C  2. IT IS LINKED WITH THE BESTDOS6 PROGRAM.

C-----------------------------------------------------------------------

C  CALCBST3.FOR							11-14-02

C  CALCBST3 IS A MAJOR VARIATION TO CALCBST2.FOR. THE MAJOR CHANGE IS 
C  THAT THIS MODULE IS LINKED WITH BESTDOS4.FOR, WHEREAS CALCBST2 IS
C  LINKED WITH BESTDOS3.FOR. BESTDOS4.FOR/CALCBST3.FOR ALLOW GENERAL 
C  MODELS WHICH CAN BE DESCRIBED BY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS AND OUTPUT 
C  EQUATION(S) CODED BY THE USER INTO SUBROUTINES DIFFEQ, OUTPUT, AND
C  SYMBOL OF FILE, npemdriv.f. I.E., THE MODEL IS NO LONGER LIMITED TO 
C  THE STANDARD 3-COMPARTMENT LINEAR MODEL.

C  THE MAJOR CODING CHANGES REQUIRED ARE AS FOLLOWS:

C  1. SUBROUTINES PARNAM AND PARNAM2 HAVE BEEN REMOVED - THEY ARE
C  NOT APPLICABLE NOW SINCE THE MENU 1/2 CODE HAS BEEN REMOVED 
C  FROM THIS PROGRAM.

C  2. SEVERAL DIMENSIONS HAVE BEEN CHANGED TO BE CONSISTENT ACROSS
C  ALL ROUTINES WHICH HAVE THE SAME COMMONS. E.G., TIM(150) HAS
C  BE CHANGED TO TIM(594) AND YO(150,4) HAS BEEN CHANGED TO
C  YO(594,6). BOTH OF THESE ARE IN COMMON/OBSER. 

C  3. M HAS BEEN REMOVED FROM THE ARGUMENT LIST OF SUBROUTINE GETPRED;
C  IT WILL BE PASSED VIA COMMON/SUM2

C  4. NVAR WAS REMOVED AS AN ARGUMENT TO SUBROUTINES WSUMSQ AND 
C  CALCPRED. IT WILL BE REPLACED BY NP (TOTAL NO. OF BOTH RANDOM
C  AND FIXED PARAMETERS IN CALCPRED).

C  5. SUBROUTINE CALCPRED WAS CHANGED TO BE LIKE MAIN OF idfix5f.f.

C  6. SUBROUTINE GETPRED WAS CHANGED TO BE ESSENTIALLY LIKE SUBROUTINE
C  FUNC OF MODULE, idfix5f.f.

C  7. SUBROUTINES ANAL3, CASE1,...,CASE4 HAVE BEEN REMOVED. 

C  8. SUBROUTINES USERANAL AND JACOB ARE PUT IN FROM idfix5f.f. 
C     SUBROUTINE MAKEVEC IS PUT IN FROM bignpaglap1.f. MAKEVEC IS
C     CALLED BELOW TO PUT INTO ONE VECTOR ALL THE PARAMETER VALUES 
C     (RANDOM AND FIXED) FOR EACH GRID POINT.

C  9. NEW COMMON/FROMBEST PROVIDES THE VALUES NEEDED IN THE CALL TO
C     NEW SUBROUTINE MAKEVEC (SEE ABOVE).

C 10. THE MODULES, npemdriv.f (EDITED AS DESIRED BY THE USER) AND 
C  vodtot.f, WILL ALSO BE LINKED WITH THIS MODULE TO BE PART OF THE
C  BESTDOS4.FOR PROGRAM. vodtot.f MUST BE LINKED SINCE SUBROUTINE DVODE 
C  IS CALLED BY SUBROUTINE USERANAL. 

C 11. SUBROUTINE OUTPUT HAS BEEN REMOVED SINCE IT WILL NOW BE A PART
C  OF MODULE, npemdriv.f, WHICH WILL BE EDITED BY THE USER.

C 12. THE MAXIMUM NO. OF GRID POINTS WHICH CAN BE USED (I.E., THE NO.
C  OF GRID POINTS READ IN FROM THE MATLAB FILE BY BESTDOS4.FOR) IS
C  CURRENTLY SET = MAXGRD = 5003.

C-----------------------------------------------------------------------

C  CALCBST2.FOR							9-29-01

C  CALCBST2 IS A SLIGHT EXTENSION TO CALCBEST. THE DIFFERENCE IS THAT,
C  FOR EACH GRID POINT IN THE INPUT DENSITY, THE ACHIEVED CONCENTRATIONS
C  FOR THE CURRENT BEST SET OF DOSES (I.E., THOSE GIVING THE MINIMUM
C  EXPSUM IN SUBROUTINE CALCS) ARE STORED IN COMMON/PREDVAL, WHICH WILL 
C  BE USED IN MAIN.

C-----------------------------------------------------------------------

C  CALCBEST.FOR							8-25-01

C  CALCBEST (SUBROUTINE CALCS) IS A VARIATION OF CALCS.FOR ... TO BE 
C  USED WITH BESTDOSE.FOR. BESTDOSE CALLS ELDERY (WHICH USES THE 
C  NELDER MEED ALGORITHM) TO FIND THE BEST SET OF NDOS DOSES (AT THE 
C  TIMES READ IN FROM THE PATIENT DATA FILE BY SUBROUTINE FILRED - 
C  THESE TIMES ARE PUT INTO COMMON BY FILRED) TO MINIMIZE THE EXPECTED 
C  WEIGHTED SUM OF SQUARES OF DIFFERENCES BETWEEN OBSERVED AND TARGET


C  CONCENTRATIONS (THE OBSERVATION TIMES AND TARGET CONCENTRATIONS ARE 
C  ALSO READ IN BY FILRED AND PUT INTO COMMONS TO BE USED BY SUBROUTINE 
C  CALCS). THE EXPECTED VALUE IS OVER THE PRIOR DENSITY (HAVING
C  PARAMETER VALUES AND CORRESPONDING DENSITIES).

C  COMMON/PREVAL CONTAINS PREDMIN WHICH CONTAINS THE PREDICTED VALUES
C  FOR EACH GRID POINT FOR THE BEST SET OF DOSES SO FAR (I.E., THOSE
C  FOR WHICH THE EXPSUM IS MINIMUM SO FAR). ALSO, SUMM IS THE MINIMUM 
C  ACHIEVED VALUE OF EXPSUM SO FAR, AND CORRESPONDS TO PREDMIN VALUES.

C  COMMON/TOCALC CONTAINS THE FOLLOWING INFO:

C   1. NOBSER = NO. OF OBSERVED VALUE TIMES IN THE PATIENT DATA FILE.
C   2. NGRD = NO. OF GRID POINTS OVER WHICH THE ABOVE EXPECTED VALUE
C             IS TO BE CALCULATED.
C   3. NVAR = NO. OF DIMENSIONS IN THE RANDOM PARAMETER VECTOR.
C   4. DENSITY(I,J) = VALUE OF THE JTH RANDOM VARIABLE FOR GRID POINT I,
C                    J=1,NVAR; I=1,NGRD.

C      TERM IN THE CALCULATION.
C   6. NUMEQT = NO. OF OUTPUT EQUATIONS IN THE PATIENT DATA FILE.
C   7. NDD41 = NO. OF DOSE EVENTS IN THE "PAST".

C  COMMON/FROMBEST PROVIDES THE VALUES TO THIS ROUTINE WHICH ARE 
C  IN THE CALL TO MAKEVEC BELOW.


C  THIS ROUTINE, CALLED BY ELDERY, FINDS THE FUNCTIONAL VALUE, EXPSUM


C  FOR THE SUPPLIED VARIABLE VECTOR, DOSES(I),I=1,NDOS.

C    EXPSUM CONSISTS OF TWO TERMS:

C     THE FIRST IS THE EXPECTED SUM OF SQUARES OF DIFFERENCES BETWEEN
C     OBSERVED AND TARGET VALUES (THE OBSERVATION TIMES AND TARGET
C     VALUES ARE READ IN BY FILRED AND PUT INTO COMMONS
C     TO BE USED BY OTHER ROUTINES CALLED BY THIS ROUTINE). THE 
C     EXPECTED VALUE IS OVER THE PRIOR DENSITY (HAVING PARAMETER VALUES
C     AND CORRESPONDING DENSITIES). 

C     THE SECOND IS THE EXPECTED SUM OF SQUARES OF DIFFERENCES BETWEEN
C     THE MEAN RESPONSES AND THE TARGETS (THIS IS ALSO CALLED THE
C     BIAS TERM).



C  1ST CHECK THAT ALL THE ENTRIES IN DOSES ARE NON-NEGATIVE. IF ANY 

C  ISN'T, RETURN A LARGE POSITIVE VALUE (AN UNATTRACTIVE VALUE) FOR

C  TSTMULTI.FOR IMPLIES THAT THE FA(.) COULD BE FUNCTIONS OF THE
C  COVARIATES, AND SO THIS CHANGE IS NECESSARY.

C  NOTE THAT SETTING THE R(.) TO RS(.,.) BEFORE THE FIRST CALL TO
C  GETFA ALSO MEANS THE R(.) WILL BE SET BEFORE GETIX AND GETTLAG ARE
C  FIRST CALLED, WHICH AGAIN IS REQUIRED IN CASE THEY ESTABLISH VALUES
C  AS FUNCTIONS OF THE COVARIATES IN THE PATIENT DATA FILE.

c  idm1x12.f                                               7/25/12

c  idm1x12 has the following change to idm1x11:

c  In SUBROUTINE FUNC, the code to save ND0, SIGO, RSO, is moved to
c  before the IF(N .EQ. 0) GO TO 75  statement. The reason is that 
c  before this  routine returns, ND, SIG, and RS are reset back to these
c  values, even if N = 0, and so they must be established at this time.

c-----------------------------------------------------------------------

c  idm1x11.f                                               5/25/12

c  idm1x11 has the following changes from idm1x10:

C  IT HAS CODE CHANGES IN SUBROUTINE PREDLAST3 TO HANDLE THE CASE WHERE
C  PRED1 + PRED3 - 2*PRED2 = 0 --> PREDNEG SHOULD NOT BE CALCULATED. 
C  USUALLY THIS WILL HAPPEN WHEN THE MODEL/DOSAGE REGIMEN IS SO "EASY"
C  TO PREDICT THAT THE 3 PREDICTED VALUES ARE VERY CLOSE TO EACH OTHER,
C  AND BY "BAD LUCK" COULD BE IN A LINEAR PROGRESSION. I.E., IF
C  PRED1 + DEL = PRED2, AND PRED2 + DEL = PRED3, THEN 
C  PRED1 + PRED3 - 2*PRED2 = 0.

C  IN THIS CASE, OF COURSE, PREDNEG SHOULD NOT BE CALCULATED SINCE THAT
C  WILL RESULT IN A DIVIDE BY 0, OR A NaN IF THE PROGRAM DOES NOT STOP.

C  WHEN THIS HAPPENS (SEE CODE IN PREDLAST3), WHETHER OR NOT CONVERGENCE
C  IS ACHIEVED WILL DEPEND SOLELY ON THE TOL1 CRITERION (I.E., THE TOL2
C  CRITERION CANNOT BE USED, AND IS UNNEEDED).

C-----------------------------------------------------------------------

c  idm1x10.f                                               4/14/12

c  idm1x10 has the following changes to idm1x9.f:

c  It is to be used with npageng17.f, which allows steady state doses
c  to be boluses as well as IVs. As a result, an additional parameter,
c  ISKIPBOL, is used so, in Subroutine FUNC, when convergence occurs in
c  a steady state dose set, the last bolus from that set will not be
c  reapplied below label 83.

c-----------------------------------------------------------------------

c  idm1x9.f                                               3/2/12

c  idm1x9 has the following bug fix to idm1x8.f. In Subroutine FUNC, the
c  code to save ND, SIG, and RS before altering them if there are 
c  time lag parameters (in the call to GETTLAG) is now executed whether
c  or not there are time lag parameters. The reason is that, with steady
c  state doses, the first SIG(.) time in a steady state dose set is
c  reset to be 0 after the steady state dose is identified. And this
c  time must be reset back to be its original negative value at the end
c  of the routine so that the next time the routine is called, the 
c  program will again know when a steady state dose is coming. 

c-----------------------------------------------------------------------

c  idm1x8.f                                                1/15/12

c  Corrects bug in Subroutine FUNC - now time resets are identified
c  by just the observation time = 0 (i.e., the dose time = 0 is
c  no longer required). This is because it is possible for a dose
c  time (especially if there are timelags) to be after the last
c  observation time in a section of the patient file (before a time
c  reset), and if this happens, the program will not be able to
c  identify the observation time of 0 as a time reset.

c-----------------------------------------------------------------------

c  idm1x7.f                                                11/21/11

c  idm1x7 has the following changes from idm1x6:

c  1. It can accommodate steady state dose regimens as created by 
c  new subroutine NEWWORK1.FOR in npageng16.f. And it has new
c  Subroutine PREDLAST3 (both of these 2 new subroutines are based on
c  stand-a-lone versions of the same name) which is called by
c  Subroutine FUNC to predict the final (steady state) compartment
c  amounts. If these predicted values are determined to have
c  converged, the rest of the steady state dose set will be skipped
c  to save time. Note that predictions start after the end of the
c  5th dose set (out of 100 in each steady state regimen), and
c  continue until convergence is reached, or the entire steady state
c  dose set has been integrated through.

C  SO THE MAIN CHANGES TO THE CODE ARE:

C  CHECK TO SEE IF A DOSE TIME IS NEGATIVE. IF NOT, PROCEED AS USUAL. IF 
C  SO, PROCEED AS IF THAT TIME WAS 0, BUT AFTER THE END OF THAT DOSE AND 


C  THE NEXT 4, CALL SUBROUTINE PREDLAST3 TO PREDICT THE STEADY STATE
C  COMPARTMENT AMOUNTS AFTER THE 100 DOSES (NOTE THAT THE COMPARTMENT
C  AMOUNTS WILL HAVE TO BE FOUND AT THE END OF EACH OF THE STEADY STATE
C  DOSES OF COURSE AS THE LOGIC OF PREDLAST3 REQUIRES). IF CONVERGENCE
C  IS ACHIEVED, ASSIGN THE COMPARTMENT AMOUNTS TO BE THE PREDICTED
C  AMOUNTS AND SET KNS TO BE WHAT IT IS WHEN THESE STEADY STATE DOSE 
C  SETS HAVE FINISHED. ALSO, SET T = END OF THE STEADY STATE DOSE SET
C  SINCE THAT'S WHAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN HAD ALL THE DOSES BEEN 
C  INTEGRATED THROUGH.

c  2. All arrays related to doses (SIG,SIGO,RS,RSO, and BS) in
c  Subroutine FUNC have their 500's changed to 5000's. This is because
c  each set of 100 steady state doses, with each of up to 7 drugs having
c  its own stopping time, could require an extra 100 x 8 dose events, 
c  and there could be multiple steady state sets (they can occur at the
c  start of the dose regimen, or at any time reset point).

c  3. Near the top of Subroutine FUNC, R(1)=0.0D0 is replaced by setting
c  R(2*I-1) = 0.D0, for I = 1,NDRUG. This should have been done when
c  the program became a multi-drug program (see comment in FUNC).

c  4. A time reset no longer requires all initial compartment amounts
c  to be reset to 0. This is because a time reset no longer has to mean
c  an "infinite" amount of time has occurred with no dosing; it can also
c  now mean an "infinite" amount of time has occurred with unknown 
c  dosing. So Subroutine GETIX will be called to establish initial
c  conditions for the new time period (these initial values can of
c  course be 0's as was always assumed in previous programs). This is
c  the situation where a patient, who previously had doses and
c  observations which were recorded while he was in a lab, goes home and
c  gets unknown doses over a long time period, and then returns to the
c  lab to get a new set of doses and observations, starting with 
c  observations which establish his initial conditions for this new
c  time period.

c  idm1x6.f                                                12/20/10

c  idm1x6 has the following change to idm1x5:

c  In Subroutine FUNC, it has code that calls Subroutine ANAL3, rather
c  than USERANAL if N .EQ. -1. Also, the code to reset X(I),I=1,N to 0
c  where there is a time reset now includes extra code to set 
c  X(I),I=1,3 to 0 if N .EQ. -1.

c  Note that ANAL3, and the routines it calls are from the Little NPAG

c  program module, IDPC9A.FOR. 

c  Note that this module is linked first with bigmlt11.f, and the 
c  template model file is TSTMULTH.FOR (in which in Subroutine SYMBOL,
c  the user is told to code N=-1 if he wants to assume the standard
c  3-compartment linear model with analytic solutions, and in this 
c  case also establish the 5 parameters, {KE,KA,KCP,KPC,V} of this
c  model).

c-----------------------------------------------------------------------

c  idm1x5.f							4/03/10

c  idm1x5 has a bug correction to idm1x4. In Subroutine FUNC, in the
c  IF(TIM(KNT) .EQ. 0.D0 .AND. SIG(KNS) .EQ. 0.D0) block, the time,
c  T, is also reset = 0 since the integration will again start from
c  time 0. When this wasn't done (in idm1x4.f), the results were
c  unpredictable (depending on how the DVODE integration routines
c  treated a (T,TOUT) pair which decreased rather than increased.

c-----------------------------------------------------------------------

c  idm1x4.f							11/23/09

c  idm1x4 fixes a bug in the idm1x3 code. Label 75 is moved to in
c  front of the  CALL GETTLAG(TLAG)  statement (see the reason in
c  that part of the code).

c-----------------------------------------------------------------------

c  idm1x3.f							9/18/09

c  idm1x3 has the following changes from idm1x2:

c  1. The TLAG and FA vectors, and the initial values for the X array 
c  will be set by calling new routines (GETTLAG, GETFA, and GETIX, 
c  respectively) that are part of the model file (the new template is 
c  TSTMULT.FOR). This means the user can now code explicit formulas
c  for these values. As a result, all reference to NTLAG, IC, IFA, and
c  IVOL have been removed.

c  2. The shift subroutine will now be from the module, shift5.f, 
c  rather than shift4.f.

c  3. In Subroutine USERANAL, ISTATE is no longer written out. This
c  can slow the program a lot if the numerical integrator (DVODE) is
c  struggling with the integrations. Instead, the total no. of calls to
c  XERRWD (the routine which writes the details of the warnings) is 
c  written to the screen by the main "engine" module, currently 
c  bigmlt4.f.

c  Note that this module, along with idm2x3.f, id3x3.f, and shift5.f
c  are part of the new "engine", whose main module is bigmlt4.f.

c-----------------------------------------------------------------------

c  idm1x2.f							8/14/09


c  idm1x2 has the following changes from idm1x1:

c  1. The code for setting initial compartment amounts from initial
c  compartment concentrations is changed to reflect the fact that
c  now IC(2) refers to the index of the covariates, not the
c  column no. of RS (see comment in code).

c  2. The code to establish the timelag parameters has changed to
c  reflect that NTLAG(I) can now be negative --> in Subroutine
c  SHIFT, the associated timelag parameter will now be the 
c  exponent of the indicated parameter (rather than the parameter 
c  itself).

c  3. The code to establish the FA parameters has changed to
c  reflect that IFA(I) can now be negative --> the associated FA
c  parameter will now be the exponent of the indicated parameter 
c  (rather than the parameter itself).


c  idm1x2.f (along with other new modules idm2x2.f and idm3x2.f) are
c  still called by bigmlt2.f, but are part of the "engine" for the
c  new NPBIG15B.FOR program.

c-----------------------------------------------------------------------

c  idm1x1.f							5/27/09


c  idm1x1.f has the following changes from idfix5g.f:

c  1. It allows the extra option of setting initial compartment 
c  amounts from their initial concentrations - see code in Subroutine 
c  FUNC. 

c  2. It is part of the new Big NPAG "engine", bigmlt2.f, which allows 
c  patient data files to have "reset" values of 0 in the dosage and 
c  sampling blocks. Whenever, in Subroutine FUNC, the program sees a 
c  SIG(.) = 0 and a TIM(.) = 0, it knows that a large enough time has 
c  passed since the last dose that all compartment amounts are to be 
c  reset = 0. Subsequent dose and observed value times are then values 
c  from this point.

c  3. The first argument to Subroutine OUTPUT is changed from 0.0 to 
c  0.D0 in two places.

c  This module, along with idm2x1.f and idm3x1.f are first used in the 
c  bigmlt2.f program.

c-----------------------------------------------------------------------

c  idfix5g.f							5-28-02


c  idfix5g has the following changes from idfix5f.f:

c  It allows multiple drug inputs (rather than just one drug input).
c  The changes required for this are:

c  1. BS has dimension change from (500,3) to (500,7)
c  2. COMMON/CNST2 is changed to include NDRUG (no. of drugs) and
c     NADD (no. of additional covariates), rather than NBI and NRI.
c  3. NTLAG is now a vector instead of a scalar. In particular, 
C     NTLAG(I) = 0 IF DRUG I'S BOLUS COL. HAS NO TIMELAG PARAMETER;
C                K IF DRUG I'S BOLUS COL. HAS A TIMELAG WHOSE VALUE IS
C		   GIVEN BY PARAMETER NO K.
C  4. IFA, PASSED IN COMMON/FRABS FROM SUBROUTINE SYMBOL IS NOW A VECTOR
C     INSTEAD OF A SCALAR.
C     IFA(I) = 0 IF DRUG I WILL HAVE FA = 1.0.
C              K IF DRUG I WILL HAVE AN FA WHOSE VALUE IS TO BE GIVEN
C                BY PARAMETER K.
C  5. THE BOLUS COMPARTMENT NOS., NBCOMP(I), NOW COME VIA 
C     COMMON/BOLUSCOMP FROM SUBROUTINE SYMBOL, AND THE DIMENSION OF
C     NBCOMP HAS BEEN CHANGED TO 7 (MAXIMUM OF 1 PER DRUG) FROM 20.
C  6. ALL OF THE CODE IN SUBROUTINE FUNC RELATED TO NRI AND NBI HAS BEEN
C     CHANGED TO BE IN TERMS OF NI AND NDRUG. 
C  7. THE CODE RELATED TO CALLING SUBROUTINE SHIFT, INCLUDING THE 
C     CALLING ARGUMENTS, HAS BEEN CHANGED TO REFLECT THE ABOVE CHANGES
C     IN NTLAG (I.E., IT IS NOW A VECTOR RATHER THAN A SCALAR). A NEW
C     MODULE, shift3.f (WHICH REPLACES shift2.f) WILL BE LINKED WITH 
C     THIS MODULE.

C-----------------------------------------------------------------------

c  idfix5f.f							4-23-02

c  idfix5f has the following changes to idfix5e:

c  1. To enable FA to be a parameter value (either fixed or random), 
c  rather than always be hardcoded = 1.0, the following changes are
c  implemented ...

c  The hardcoding of FA = 1.0 and the code for NBCOMP are removed
c  from main. In addition, COMMON/BCOMP is removed from the entire 
c  module. Instead, in SUBROUTINE FUNC, a new COMMON/FRABS/IFA provides 
c  the value IFA which is the parameter index of the FA value (passed
c  from SUBROUTINE SYMBOL) unless it = 0, in which case FA is
c  set = 1.0. Also the NBCOMP compartment nos. are now set in 
c  SUBROUTINE FUNC.

c  2. COMMONS /OBSER AND /SUM2 (and the arrays in them) are deleted from 

c  main. They were not needed. Also, COMMON CNST2 is deleted from main
c  since NBI is no longer needed here (since NBCOMP code is removed -
c  see no. 1. above).

c-----------------------------------------------------------------------

c  idfix5e.f							1-22-00

c  idfix5e has the following changes to idfix5d:

c  It allows the initial conditions of the amounts in the compartments
c  to be paramater values, rather than fixed at 0.0. These parameter
c  values may be either fixed or random.


c  To affect this enhancement, the primary change is the code in 
c  subroutine FUNC which sets the initial conditions based on the 
c  values in IC which are provided by COMMON/INITCOND from 
c  SUBROUTINE SYMBOL of the Fortran model file.

c  There are many other changes to simply the code (i.e., a lot of
c  code was leftover code which was unused and/or confusing), namely:

c  - Commons ADAPT1, ADAPT2, LPARAM, PRED, TRANS, and PARAM are 
c    deleted. Variables ISW, IP, and C are deleted.
c  - COMMON/PARAMD/P is now in MAIN, FUNC, and JACOB; MAIN and
c    FUNCx of idcy_53e.f and idcy_63e.f; and DIFFEQ and OUTPUT of
c    the Fortran model file.
c  - P is redimensioned 32. It will hold only the parameters of the
c    model (although some of those parameters may be initial conditions)
c    and there are 20 allowable random paramaters and 12 allowable
c    fixed paramaters now.
c  - All the code to reverse the paramater order (using PD) and to do
c    and undo square root transformations in MAIN and FUNC is removed
c    (it was unneeded, and therefore confusing). In particular, all
c    references to NPT, NUMYES, NUIC, NUP, NPNL, and NBOT are removed.
c  - COMMON ANALYT/IDIFF is removed. IDIFF is unneeded since IDIFF = 0
c    is equivalent to N = 0, and so IDIFF code in FUNC is replaced by
c    the equivalent code for N. NEQN is replaced by N.

c  - In SUBROUTINE SUMSQ, COMMON/PARAM is removed, along with PP and P.
c    Setting PP(I) = P(I), I=1,NPNL made no sense since PP wasn't used

c    and NPNL was always = 0 anyway. P is removed as an argument to
c    SUMSQ (it was unneeded).
c  - In FUNC, the If statment at label 83 is changed to include N .EQ. 0
c    since if N = 0, setting compartment values is unnecessary.


c  idfix5e is part of the big npem program, npbig4.f.

c  set R(2*I-1) = 0, for I = 1,NDRUG. I.E., All IV rates for all NDRUG

C  As of idm1x12.f, the code to save ND0, SIGO, RSO, is moved to before
c  the IF(N .EQ. 0) GO TO 75  statement. The reason is that before this
c  routine returns, ND, SIG, and RS are reset back to these values,

C	STATE VECTOR FOR THE MODEL UNDER CONSIDERATION (AS DEFINED
C	BY THE D.E'S IN SUBROUTINE DIFFEQ). THESE D.E'S ARE SOLVED
C	USING THE LINPACK ROUTINE, VODE.FOR (AND ASSOCIATED ROUTINES).

C  	THIS ROUTINE CALLS SUBROUTINE DVODE (VODE.FOR) ONCE FOR EACH
C	POINT AT WHICH ANSWERS ARE DESIRED. NOTE THAT DVODE WILL CALL
C	SUBROUTINE DIFFEQ (SUPPLIED BY THE USER -- IT GIVES THE

C  THE LOGIC OF THIS CODE IS TAKEN FROM PROGRAM DESOLV3.FOR (4/28/96).

C  FOLLOWING VALUES ARE SUPPLIED TO SUBROUTINE DVODE:

C  DIFFEQ  = NAME OF SUBROUTINE COMPLETED BY USER WHICH GIVES THE D.E.'S 
C	     OF THE MODEL. IT MUST BE DECLARED EXTERNAL.
C TIN      = The initial value of the independent variable.

C TOUT   = First point where output is desired (.ne. TIN). 
C ITOL   = 2 SINCE ATOL IS AN ARRAY.
C RTOL   = Relative tolerance parameter (scalar).
C ATOL   = Absolute tolerance parameter.
C          The estimated local error in X(i) will be controlled so as
C          to be roughly less (in magnitude) than
C             EWT(i) = RTOL*abs(X(i)) + ATOL(i)  SINCE ITOL = 2.
C          Thus the local error test passes if, in each component,
C          either the absolute error is less than ATOL (or ATOL(i)),
C          or the relative error is less than RTOL.
C          Use RTOL = 0.0 for pure absolute error control, and
C          use ATOL = 0.0 (or ATOL(i) = 0.0) for pure relative error
C          control.  Caution.. Actual (global) errors may exceed these
C          local tolerances, so choose them conservatively.
C ITASK  = 1 for normal computation of output values of X at t = TOUT.
C ISTATE = Integer flag (input and output).  Set ISTATE = 1.
C IOPT   = 0 to indicate no optional input used.

C          and upper half-bandwidths ML,MU.
C	... I'LL USE AN ARRAY OF 40 (PLENTY FOR NDIM .LE. 8).
C LIW    = Declared length of IWORK (in user's DIMENSION).
C JACOB    = Name of subroutine COMPLETED BY USER for Jacobian matrix 
C	     (MF = 21 or 24). If used, this name must be declared 
C	     external.  If not used, pass a dummy name.
C MF     = Method flag.  Standard values are..
C          10 for nonstiff (Adams) method, no Jacobian used.
C          21 for stiff (BDF) method, user-supplied full Jacobian.
C          22 for stiff method, internally generated full Jacobian.

C          24 for stiff method, user-supplied banded Jacobian.
C          25 for stiff method, internally generated banded Jacobian.
C RPAR,IPAR = user-defined real and integer SCALARS OR arrays passed to 
C	      DIFFEQ AND JACOB.

C Note that the main program must declare arrays X, RWORK, IWORK,
C and possibly ATOL, RPAR, and IPAR.


C  THE FOLLOWING VALUES RETURN FROM CALLS TO SUBROUTINE DVODE.

C      X = Array of computed values of X vector (AT TIME TOUT).
C      T = Corresponding value of independent variable (normally TOUT).
C ISTATE = 2  if DVODE was successful, negative otherwise.
C          -1 means excess work done on this call. (Perhaps wrong MF.)
C          -2 means excess accuracy requested. (Tolerances too small.)
C          -3 means illegal input detected. (See printed message.)
C          -4 means repeated error test failures. (Check all input.)
C          -5 means repeated convergence failures. (Perhaps bad
C             Jacobian supplied or wrong choice of MF or tolerances.)

c  represents the maximum no. of compartments allowed).

c. 3. YPRED has been renamed to be YYPRED (to be consistent with 
c  the calling argument in the calling module, npageng25.f). Also,
c  this will avoid confusion with the YPRED used in the module
c  idm2x14.f.

c  4. The argument list to IDCALCYY has the additional argument,

C  THAT THE FA(.) WERE FUNCTIONS OF THE PARAMETERS, BUT NOT THE

C  COVARIATES, AND SO THIS WASN'T NECESSARY. BUT THE CODE IN 
C  TSTMULTI.FOR IMPLIES THAT THE FA(.) COULD BE FUNCTIONS OF THE
C  COVARIATES, AND SO THIS CHANGE IS NECESSARY.

C  NOTE THAT SETTING THE R(.) TO RS(.,.) BEFORE THE FIRST CALL TO
C  GETFA ALSO MEANS THE R(.) WILL BE SET BEFORE GETIX AND GETTLAG ARE
C  FIRST CALLED, WHICH AGAIN IS REQUIRED IN CASE THEY ESTABLISH VALUES
C  AS FUNCTIONS OF THE COVARIATES IN THE PATIENT DATA FILE.

c  idm3x12.f                                               7/25/12

c  idm3x12 has the following change to idm1x11:

c  In SUBROUTINE FUNC3, the code to save ND0, SIGO, RSO, is moved to
c  before the IF(N .EQ. 0) GO TO 75  statement. The reason is that 
c  before this  routine returns, ND, SIG, and RS are reset back to these
c  values, even if N = 0, and so they must be established at this time.

c-----------------------------------------------------------------------

c  idm3x11.f                                               4/14/12

c  idm3x11 has the following changes to idm2x10.f:

c  It is to be used with npageng17.f, which allows steady state doses
c  to be boluses as well as IVs. As a result, an additional parameter,
c  ISKIPBOL, is used so, in Subroutine FUNC, when convergence occurs in
c  a steady state dose set, the last bolus from that set will not be
c  reapplied below label 83.

c-----------------------------------------------------------------------

c  idm3x10.f                                               4/10/12

c  idm3x10 has one small 'bug' fix to idm3x9:

c  In Subroutine FUNC3, at label 40, and just below it in the do loop,
c  NUMT+1 is replaced by NUMT. Also, all comment references to NUMT+1 
c  are replaced by NUMT. The reason is that the no. of times at which
c  predicted values are required is NUMT, not NUMT+1. This can, in
c  rare situations, mean that TPRED(NUMT+1) = 0 can cause the program
c  to stop with an error message (see code around format 111). 

c-----------------------------------------------------------------------

c  idm3x9.f                                               3/2/12

c  idm3x9 has the following bug fix to idm3x8.f. In Subroutine FUNC3, 
c  the code to save ND, SIG, and RS before altering them if there are 
c  time lag parameters (in the call to GETTLAG) is now executed whether
c  or not there are time lag parameters. The reason is that, with steady
c  state doses, the first SIG(.) time in a steady state dose set is
c  reset to be 0 after the steady state dose is identified. And this
c  time must be reset back to be its original negative value at the end
c  of the routine so that the next time the routine is called, the 
c  program will again know when a steady state dose is coming. 

c-----------------------------------------------------------------------

c  idm3x8.f                                                1/15/12

c  Corrects bug in Subroutine FUNC3 - now time resets are identified
c  by just the observation time = 0 (i.e., the dose time = 0 is
c  no longer required). This is because it is possible for a dose
c  time (especially if there are timelags) to be after the last
c  observation time in a section of the patient file (before a time
c  reset), and if this happens, the program will not be able to
c  identify the observation time of 0 as a time reset.

c-----------------------------------------------------------------------

c  idm3x7.f                                                11/11/11

c  idm3x7 has the same changes to idm3x6 that idm1x7 has from idm1x6
c  (see all the comments in idm1x7.f for explanations). In particular:

c  1. It can accommodate steady state dose regimens.

c  2. All arrays related to doses (SIG,SIGO,RS,RSO, and BS) in
c  Subroutine FUNC have their 500's changed to 5000's.

c  3. Near the top of Subroutine FUNC, R(1)=0.0D0 is replaced by setting
c  R(2*I-1) = 0.D0, for I = 1,NDRUG. This should have been done when
c  the program became a multi-drug program (see comment in FUNC).

c  4. A time reset no longer requires all initial compartment amounts
c  to be reset to 0. This is because a time reset no longer has to mean
c  an "infinite" amount of time has occurred with no dosing; it can also
c  now mean an "infinite" amount of time has occurred with unknown 
c  dosing. So Subroutine GETIX will be called to establish initial
c  conditions for the new time period (these initial values can of
c  course be 0's as was always assumed in previous programs). This is
c  the situation where a patient, who previously had doses and
c  observations which were recorded while he was in a lab, goes home and
c  gets unknown doses over a long time period, and then returns to the
c  lab to get a new set of doses and observations, starting with 
c  observations which establish his initial conditions for this new
c  time period.

c  idm3x6.f                                                12/20/10

c  idm3x6 has the following change to idm3x5:

c  In Subroutine FUNC3, it has code that calls Subroutine ANAL3, rather
c  than USERANAL if N .EQ. -1. Also, the code to reset X(I),I=1,N to 0
c  where there is a time reset now includes extra code to set 
c  X(I),I=1,3 to 0 if N .EQ. -1.

c  Note that ANAL3, and the routines it calls are from the Little NPAG
c  program module, IDPC9A.FOR. 

c  Note that this module is linked first with bigmlt11.f, and the 
c  template model file is TSTMULTH.FOR (in which in Subroutine SYMBOL,
c  the user is told to code N=-1 if he wants to assume the standard
c  3-compartment linear model with analytic solutions, and in this 
c  case also establish the 5 parameters, {KE,KA,KCP,KPC,V} of this
c  model).

c-----------------------------------------------------------------------

c  idm3x5.f							4/03/10

c  idm3x5 has a bug correction to idm3x4. In Subroutine FUNC3, in the
c  IF(TPRED(KNT) .EQ. 0.D0 .AND. SIG(KNS) .EQ. 0.D0) block, the time,
c  T, is also reset = 0 since the integration will again start from
c  time 0. When this wasn't done (in idm3x4.f), the results were
c  unpredictable (depending on how the DVODE integration routines
c  treated a (T,TOUT) pair which decreased rather than increased.

c-----------------------------------------------------------------------

c  idm3x4.f							11/23/09

c  idm3x4 fixes a bug in the idm3x3 code. Label 75 is moved to in
c  front of the  CALL GETTLAG(TLAG)  statement (see the reason in
c  that part of the code).

c-----------------------------------------------------------------------

c  idm3x3.f							9/18/09

c  idm3x3 has the following changes from idm3x2:

c  1. The TLAG and FA vectors, and the initial values for the X array 
c  will be set by calling new routines (GETTLAG, GETFA, and GETIX, 
c  respectively) that are part of the model file (the new template is 
c  TSTMULT.FOR). This means the user can now code explicit formulas
c  for these values. As a result, all reference to NTLAG, IC, IFA, and
c  IVOL have been removed.

c  2. The shift subroutine will now be from the module, shift5.f, 
c  rather than shift4.f.

c  Note that this module, along with idm1x3.f, id2x3.f, and shift5.f
c  are part of the new "engine", whose main module is bigmlt4.f.

c-----------------------------------------------------------------------

c  idm3x2.f							8/14/09

c  idm3x2 has the following changes from idm3x1:

c  1. The code for setting initial compartment amounts from initial
c  compartment concentrations is changed to reflect the fact that
c  now IC(2) refers to the index of the covariates, not the
c  column no. of RS (see comment in code).

c  2. The code to establish the timelag parameters has changed to
c  reflect that NTLAG(I) can now be negative --> in Subroutine
c  SHIFT, the associated timelag parameter will now be the 
c  exponent of the indicated parameter (rather than the parameter 
c  itself).

c  3. The code to establish the FA parameters has changed to
c  reflect that IFA(I) can now be negative --> the associated FA
c  parameter will now be the exponent of the indicated parameter 
c  (rather than the parameter itself).


c  idm3x2.f (along with other new modules idm1x2.f and idm2x2.f) are
c  still called by bigmlt2.f, but are part of the "engine" for the
c  new NPBIG15B.FOR program.

c-----------------------------------------------------------------------


c  idm3x1.f							5/27/09

c  idm3x1.f has the following changes from idcy_63f.f:

c  1. It allows the extra option of setting initial compartment 
c  amounts from their initial concentrations - see code in Subroutine 
c  FUNC3.

c  2. It is part of the new Big NPAG "engine", bigmlt2.f, which allows 
c  patient data files to have "reset" values of 0 in the dosage and 
c  sampling blocks. Whenever, in Subroutine FUNC2, the program sees a 
c  SIG(.) = 0 and a TIM(.) = 0, it knows that a large enough time has 
c  passed since the last dose that all compartment amounts are to be 
c  reset = 0. Subsequent dose and observed value times are then values 
c  from this point.

c  3. The first argument to Subroutine OUTPUT is changed from 0.0 to 
c  0.D0 in two places.


c  This module, along with idm1x1.f and idm2x1.f are first used in the 
c  bigmlt2.f program.

c-----------------------------------------------------------------------



c  idcy_63g.f							5-28-02

c  idcy_63g has the following changes from idcy_63f:

c  It allows multiple drug inputs (rather than just one drug input).
c  The changes required for this are:

c  1. BS has dimension change from (500,3) to (500,7)
c  2. COMMON/CNST2 is changed to include NDRUG (no. of drugs) and
c     NADD (no. of additional covariates), rather than NBI and NRI.
c  3. NTLAG is now a vector instead of a scalar. In particular, 
C     NTLAG(I) = 0 IF DRUG I'S BOLUS COL. HAS NO TIMELAG PARAMETER;
C                K IF DRUG I'S BOLUS COL. HAS A TIMELAG WHOSE VALUE IS
C		   GIVEN BY PARAMETER NO K.
C  4. IFA, PASSED IN COMMON/FRABS FROM SUBROUTINE SYMBOL IS NOW A VECTOR
C     INSTEAD OF A SCALAR.
C     IFA(I) = 0 IF DRUG I WILL HAVE FA = 1.0.
C              K IF DRUG I WILL HAVE AN FA WHOSE VALUE IS TO BE GIVEN
C                BY PARAMETER K.
C  5. THE BOLUS COMPARTMENT NOS., NBCOMP(I), NOW COME VIA 
C     COMMON/BOLUSCOMP FROM SUBROUTINE SYMBOL, AND THE DIMENSION OF
C     NBCOMP HAS BEEN CHANGED TO 7 (MAXIMUM OF 1 PER DRUG) FROM 20.
C  6. ALL OF THE CODE IN SUBROUTINE FUNC3 RELATED TO NRI AND NBI HAS 
C     BEEN CHANGED TO BE IN TERMS OF NI AND NDRUG. 
C  7. THE CODE RELATED TO CALLING SUBROUTINE SHIFT, INCLUDING THE 
C     CALLING ARGUMENTS, HAS BEEN CHANGED TO REFLECT THE ABOVE CHANGES
C     IN NTLAG (I.E., IT IS NOW A VECTOR RATHER THAN A SCALAR). A NEW
C     MODULE, shift3.f (WHICH REPLACES shift2.f) WILL BE LINKED WITH 
C     THIS MODULE.

C-----------------------------------------------------------------------

c  idcy_63f.f							4-23-02


c  idcy_63f has the following changes to idcy_63e:

c  1. To enable FA to be a parameter value (either fixed or random), 
c  rather than always be hardcoded = 1.0, the following changes are
c  implemented ...

c  The hardcoding of FA = 1.0 and the code for NBCOMP are removed
c  from main. In addition, COMMON/BCOMP is removed from the entire 
c  module. Instead, in SUBROUTINE FUNC3, a new COMMON/FRABS/IFA provides 
c  the value IFA which is the parameter index of the FA value (passed
c  from SUBROUTINE SYMBOL) unless it = 0, in which case FA is
c  set = 1.0. Also the NBCOMP compartment nos. are now set in 
c  SUBROUTINE FUNC3.

c  2. COMMONS /OBSER AND /SUM2 (and the arrays in them) are deleted from 
c  main. They were not needed. Also, COMMON CNST2 is deleted from main
c  since NBI is no longer needed here (since NBCOMP code is removed -
c  see no. 1. above).

c-----------------------------------------------------------------------

c  idcy_63e.f							1-22-00

c  idcy_63e has the following changes to idcy_63d:

c  It allows the initial conditions of the amounts in the compartments
c  to be paramater values, rather than fixed at 0.0. These parameter
c  values may be either fixed or random.

c  To affect this enhancement, the primary change is the code in 
c  subroutine FUNC3 which sets the initial conditions based on the 
c  values in IC which are provided by COMMON/INITCOND from 
c  SUBROUTINE SYMBOL of the Fortran model file.

c  There are many other changes to simply the code (i.e., a lot of
c  code was leftover code which was unused and/or confusing), namely:

c  - Commons ADAPT1, ADAPT2, LPARAM, PRED, TRANS, and PARAM are 
c    deleted. Variables ISW, IP, and C are deleted.
c  - COMMON/PARAMD/P is now in MAIN, FUNC, and JACOB of idfix5e.f; 
c    MAIN and FUNCx of idcy_53e.f and idcy_63e.f; and DIFFEQ and OUTPUT 
c    of the Fortran model file.
c  - P is redimensioned 32. It will hold only the parameters of the
c    model (although some of those parameters may be initial conditions)
c    and there are 20 allowable random paramaters and 12 allowable
c    fixed paramaters now.
c  - All the code to reverse the paramater order (using PD) and to do
c    and undo square root transformations in MAIN and FUNC3 is removed
c    (it was unneeded, and therefore confusing). In particular, all
c    references to NPT, NUMYES, NUIC, NUP, NPNL, and NBOT are removed.
c  - COMMON ANALYT/IDIFF is removed. IDIFF is unneeded since IDIFF = 0
c    is equivalent to N = 0, and so IDIFF code in FUNC3 is replaced by
c    the equivalent code for N. NEQN is replaced by N.
c  - In SUBROUTINE EVAL3, COMMON/PARAM is removed, along with PP and P.
c    Setting PP(I) = P(I), I=1,NPNL made no sense since PP wasn't used
c    and NPNL was always = 0 anyway.
c  - In FUNC3, the If statment at label 83 is changed to include 
c    N .EQ. 0 since if N = 0, setting compartment values is unnecessary.

c  idcy_63e is part of the big npem program, npbig4.f.

c  npageng22 has the following change from npageng21:

c  1. It comments out the PAUSE statement following Format 164 in 
c  Subroutine emint. Reason: the program will not complete properly if 
c  it is run under  Pmetrics (which cannot supply a keyboard response
c  during a run). 

c  2. Formats 1657 and 7124 are changed to show that the output file
c  is made by npageng22 rather than npageng21.

cbegin statistics


c now we compute all hte statistical stuff using this distribution
c and the full nactve (before condensation) points.
c Later, in the condensation performed just before the grid refienment
c and subsequent expansion, we will condense by just using the
c 'keep' flags in DENSTOR(i,1) that emint left there.  The density will
c not be updated to refelct this cahnge (there is no need)
c until the next call to emint


c  As of npageng18.f, save CORDEN to CORDLAST AND NACTVE TO NACTLAST.
c  The reason is that if, somewhere during the next cycle's calculations
c  (during one of the calls to Subroutine emint), a Hessian Matrix is
c  singular, then IHESS will be set = -1, and the program will stop.
c  And in this case, the program must be able to write out all of the
c  information from this cycle (the last completed cycle). And that
c  means that the CORDEN from this cycle (which will be stored into 
c  CORDLAST), and NACTVE (store into NACTLAST) should be used in the
c  call to Subroutine SUBRES in loop 7000. Otherwise, the CORDEN and
c  NACTVE used in that call would have already partly updated in the
c  next cycle before the Hessian error occurred.

      DO I = 1,NACTVE

c - SPECIAL CHANGE FOR bigmlt10.f

c  When Andreas' Intel compiler compiles the program, it objects to
c  RPAR and IPAR being dimensioned (as (*)) in Subroutine DVODE (and
c  routines called by DVODE) when they are not dimensioned in 
c  Subroutine USERANAL (in idm1x5.f). The comments in DVODE state that
c  if these values are not being used, they do not need to be 
c  dimensioned in routines that call DVODE. Nevertheless, to remove the
c  Intel objection, RPAR(*) and IPAR(*) are removed from the 5 routines

c  in this module which declare them arrays.

c  Similarly, RTOL supposedly does not need to be dimensioned in 

c  USERANAL since it is a scalar, but the Intel compiler objects to
c  having it dimensioned (*) in DVODE, etc. when it is a scalar in
c  USERANAL. So, all RTOL(*) occurrences are removed in this module,
c  and all references to RTOL(1), RTOL(I), etc. are changed to RTOL.

C Summary of usage.
C
C Communication between the user and the DVODE package, for normal
C situations, is summarized here.  This summary describes only a subset
C of the full set of options available.  See the full description for
C details, including optional communication, nonstandard options,
C and instructions for special situations.  See also the example
C problem (with program and output) following this summary.
C
C A. First provide a subroutine of the form..
C
C           SUBROUTINE F (NEQ, T, Y, YDOT, RPAR, IPAR)
C           DOUBLE PRECISION T, Y, YDOT, RPAR
C           DIMENSION Y(NEQ), YDOT(NEQ)
C
C which supplies the vector function f by loading YDOT(i) with f(i).
C
C B. Next determine (or guess) whether or not the problem is stiff.
C Stiffness occurs when the Jacobian matrix df/dy has an eigenvalue
C whose real part is negative and large in magnitude, compared to the
C reciprocal of the t span of interest.  If the problem is nonstiff,
C use a method flag MF = 10.  If it is stiff, there are four standard
C choices for MF (21, 22, 24, 25), and DVODE requires the Jacobian
C matrix in some form.  In these cases (MF .gt. 0), DVODE will use a
C saved copy of the Jacobian matrix.  If this is undesirable because of
C storage limitations, set MF to the corresponding negative value
C (-21, -22, -24, -25).  (See full description of MF below.)
C The Jacobian matrix is regarded either as full (MF = 21 or 22),
C or banded (MF = 24 or 25).  In the banded case, DVODE requires two
C half-bandwidth parameters ML and MU.  These are, respectively, the
C widths of the lower and upper parts of the band, excluding the main
C diagonal.  Thus the band consists of the locations (i,j) with
C i-ML .le. j .le. i+MU, and the full bandwidth is ML+MU+1.
C
C C. If the problem is stiff, you are encouraged to supply the Jacobian
C directly (MF = 21 or 24), but if this is not feasible, DVODE will
C compute it internally by difference quotients (MF = 22 or 25).
C If you are supplying the Jacobian, provide a subroutine of the form..
C
C           SUBROUTINE JAC (NEQ, T, Y, ML, MU, PD, NROWPD, RPAR, IPAR)
C           DOUBLE PRECISION T, Y, PD, RPAR
C           DIMENSION Y(NEQ), PD(NROWPD,NEQ)
C
C which supplies df/dy by loading PD as follows..
C     For a full Jacobian (MF = 21), load PD(i,j) with df(i)/dy(j),
C the partial derivative of f(i) with respect to y(j).  (Ignore the
C ML and MU arguments in this case.)
C     For a banded Jacobian (MF = 24), load PD(i-j+MU+1,j) with
C df(i)/dy(j), i.e. load the diagonal lines of df/dy into the rows of
C PD from the top down.
C     In either case, only nonzero elements need be loaded.
C
C D. Write a main program which calls subroutine DVODE once for
C each point at which answers are desired.  This should also provide
C for possible use of logical unit 6 for output of error messages
C by DVODE.  On the first call to DVODE, supply arguments as follows..

C F      = Name of subroutine for right-hand side vector f.
C          This name must be declared external in calling program.
C NEQ    = Number of first order ODE-s.
C Y      = Array of initial values, of length NEQ.
C T      = The initial value of the independent variable.

C TOUT   = First point where output is desired (.ne. T).
C ITOL   = 1 or 2 according as ATOL (below) is a scalar or array.
C RTOL   = Relative tolerance parameter (scalar).

C ATOL   = Absolute tolerance parameter (scalar or array).
C          The estimated local error in Y(i) will be controlled so as
C          to be roughly less (in magnitude) than
C             EWT(i) = RTOL*abs(Y(i)) + ATOL     if ITOL = 1, or
C             EWT(i) = RTOL*abs(Y(i)) + ATOL(i)  if ITOL = 2.
C          Thus the local error test passes if, in each component,
C          either the absolute error is less than ATOL (or ATOL(i)),
C          or the relative error is less than RTOL.
C          Use RTOL = 0.0 for pure absolute error control, and
C          use ATOL = 0.0 (or ATOL(i) = 0.0) for pure relative error
C          control.  Caution.. Actual (global) errors may exceed these
C          local tolerances, so choose them conservatively.
C ITASK  = 1 for normal computation of output values of Y at t = TOUT.
C ISTATE = Integer flag (input and output).  Set ISTATE = 1.
C IOPT   = 0 to indicate no optional input used.
C RWORK  = Real work array of length at least..
C             20 + 16*NEQ                      for MF = 10,
C             22 +  9*NEQ + 2*NEQ**2           for MF = 21 or 22,
C             22 + 11*NEQ + (3*ML + 2*MU)*NEQ  for MF = 24 or 25.
C LRW    = Declared length of RWORK (in user's DIMENSION statement).
C IWORK  = Integer work array of length at least..
C             30        for MF = 10,
C             30 + NEQ  for MF = 21, 22, 24, or 25.
C          If MF = 24 or 25, input in IWORK(1),IWORK(2) the lower
C          and upper half-bandwidths ML,MU.
C LIW    = Declared length of IWORK (in user's DIMENSION).
C JAC    = Name of subroutine for Jacobian matrix (MF = 21 or 24).
C          If used, this name must be declared external in calling
C          program.  If not used, pass a dummy name.

C MF     = Method flag.  Standard values are..
C          10 for nonstiff (Adams) method, no Jacobian used.
C          21 for stiff (BDF) method, user-supplied full Jacobian.

C          22 for stiff method, internally generated full Jacobian.
C          24 for stiff method, user-supplied banded Jacobian.
C          25 for stiff method, internally generated banded Jacobian.
C RPAR,IPAR = user-defined real and integer arrays passed to F and JAC.
C Note that the main program must declare arrays Y, RWORK, IWORK,
C and possibly ATOL, RPAR, and IPAR.
C
C E. The output from the first call (or any call) is..
C      Y = Array of computed values of y(t) vector.
C      T = Corresponding value of independent variable (normally TOUT).
C ISTATE = 2  if DVODE was successful, negative otherwise.
C          -1 means excess work done on this call. (Perhaps wrong MF.)
C          -2 means excess accuracy requested. (Tolerances too small.)
C          -3 means illegal input detected. (See printed message.)
C          -4 means repeated error test failures. (Check all input.)
C          -5 means repeated convergence failures. (Perhaps bad
C             Jacobian supplied or wrong choice of MF or tolerances.)
C          -6 means error weight became zero during problem. (Solution
C             component i vanished, and ATOL or ATOL(i) = 0.)
C
C F. To continue the integration after a successful return, simply
C reset TOUT and call DVODE again.  No other parameters need be reset.

C EXAMPLE PROBLEM
C
C The following is a simple example problem, with the coding
C needed for its solution by DVODE.  The problem is from chemical
C kinetics, and consists of the following three rate equations..
C     dy1/dt = -.04*y1 + 1.e4*y2*y3
C     dy2/dt = .04*y1 - 1.e4*y2*y3 - 3.e7*y2**2
C     dy3/dt = 3.e7*y2**2

C on the interval from t = 0.0 to t = 4.e10, with initial conditions
C y1 = 1.0, y2 = y3 = 0.  The problem is stiff.

C

C The following coding solves this problem with DVODE, using MF = 21
C and printing results at t = .4, 4., ..., 4.e10.  It uses
C ITOL = 2 and ATOL much smaller for y2 than y1 or y3 because
C y2 has much smaller values.
C At the end of the run, statistical quantities of interest are
C printed. (See optional output in the full description below.)

C Full description of user interface to DVODE.
C
C The user interface to DVODE consists of the following parts.
C
C i.   The call sequence to subroutine DVODE, which is a driver
C      routine for the solver.  This includes descriptions of both
C      the call sequence arguments and of user-supplied routines.
C      Following these descriptions is
C        * a description of optional input available through the
C          call sequence,
C        * a description of optional output (in the work arrays), and
C        * instructions for interrupting and restarting a solution.
C
C ii.  Descriptions of other routines in the DVODE package that may be
C      (optionally) called by the user.  These provide the ability to
C      alter error message handling, save and restore the internal
C      COMMON, and obtain specified derivatives of the solution y(t).
C
C iii. Descriptions of COMMON blocks to be declared in overlay

C iv.  Description of two routines in the DVODE package, either of
C      which the user may replace with his own version, if desired.
C      these relate to the measurement of errors.
C
C-----------------------------------------------------------------------
C Part i.  Call Sequence.
C
C The call sequence parameters used for input only are
C     F, NEQ, TOUT, ITOL, RTOL, ATOL, ITASK, IOPT, LRW, LIW, JAC, MF,
C and those used for both input and output are
C     Y, T, ISTATE.
C The work arrays RWORK and IWORK are also used for conditional and
C optional input and optional output.  (The term output here refers
C to the return from subroutine DVODE to the user's calling program.)
C
C The legality of input parameters will be thoroughly checked on the
C initial call for the problem, but not checked thereafter unless a
C change in input parameters is flagged by ISTATE = 3 in the input.

C
C The descriptions of the call arguments are as follows.
C
C F      = The name of the user-supplied subroutine defining the
C          ODE system.  The system must be put in the first-order
C          form dy/dt = f(t,y), where f is a vector-valued function
C          of the scalar t and the vector y.  Subroutine F is to
C          compute the function f.  It is to have the form
C               SUBROUTINE F (NEQ, T, Y, YDOT, RPAR, IPAR)
C               DOUBLE PRECISION T, Y, YDOT, RPAR

C               DIMENSION Y(NEQ), YDOT(NEQ)
C          where NEQ, T, and Y are input, and the array YDOT = f(t,y)
C          is output.  Y and YDOT are arrays of length NEQ.
C          (In the DIMENSION statement above, NEQ  can be replaced by
C          *  to make  Y  and  YDOT  assumed size arrays.)
C          Subroutine F should not alter Y(1),...,Y(NEQ).
C          F must be declared EXTERNAL in the calling program.

C
C          Subroutine F may access user-defined real and integer
C          work arrays RPAR and IPAR, which are to be dimensioned

C          in the main program.
C
C          If quantities computed in the F routine are needed
C          externally to DVODE, an extra call to F should be made

C          for this purpose, for consistent and accurate results.
C          If only the derivative dy/dt is needed, use DVINDY instead.
C
C NEQ    = The size of the ODE system (number of first order
C          ordinary differential equations).  Used only for input.
C          NEQ may not be increased during the problem, but
C          can be decreased (with ISTATE = 3 in the input).

C
C Y      = A real array for the vector of dependent variables, of

C          length NEQ or more.  Used for both input and output on the
C          first call (ISTATE = 1), and only for output on other calls.
C          On the first call, Y must contain the vector of initial
C          values.  In the output, Y contains the computed solution
C          evaluated at T.  If desired, the Y array may be used

C          for other purposes between calls to the solver.
C
C          This array is passed as the Y argument in all calls to
C          F and JAC.
C
C T      = The independent variable.  In the input, T is used only on
C          the first call, as the initial point of the integration.

C          In the output, after each call, T is the value at which a
C          computed solution Y is evaluated (usually the same as TOUT).
C          On an error return, T is the farthest point reached.

C
C TOUT   = The next value of t at which a computed solution is desired.
C          Used only for input.
C
C          When starting the problem (ISTATE = 1), TOUT may be equal
C          to T for one call, then should .ne. T for the next call.
C          For the initial T, an input value of TOUT .ne. T is used
C          in order to determine the direction of the integration
C          (i.e. the algebraic sign of the step sizes) and the rough
C          scale of the problem.  Integration in either direction
C          (forward or backward in t) is permitted.
C
C          If ITASK = 2 or 5 (one-step modes), TOUT is ignored after
C          the first call (i.e. the first call with TOUT .ne. T).
C          Otherwise, TOUT is required on every call.
C
C          If ITASK = 1, 3, or 4, the values of TOUT need not be

C          monotone, but a value of TOUT which backs up is limited
C          to the current internal t interval, whose endpoints are
C          TCUR - HU and TCUR.  (See optional output, below, for
C          TCUR and HU.)
C
C ITOL   = An indicator for the type of error control.  See
C          description below under ATOL.  Used only for input.
C
C RTOL   = A relative error tolerance parameter, either a scalar or
C          an array of length NEQ.  See description below under ATOL.
C          Input only.
C
C ATOL   = An absolute error tolerance parameter, either a scalar or
C          an array of length NEQ.  Input only.
C
C          The input parameters ITOL, RTOL, and ATOL determine
C          the error control performed by the solver.  The solver will
C          control the vector e = (e(i)) of estimated local errors
C          in Y, according to an inequality of the form

C                      rms-norm of ( e(i)/EWT(i) )   .le.   1,
C          where       EWT(i) = RTOL(i)*abs(Y(i)) + ATOL(i),
C          and the rms-norm (root-mean-square norm) here is
C          rms-norm(v) = sqrt(sum v(i)**2 / NEQ).  Here EWT = (EWT(i))
C          is a vector of weights which must always be positive, and
C          the values of RTOL and ATOL should all be non-negative.
C          The following table gives the types (scalar/array) of
C          RTOL and ATOL, and the corresponding form of EWT(i).
C
C             ITOL    RTOL       ATOL          EWT(i)
C              1     scalar     scalar     RTOL*ABS(Y(i)) + ATOL
C              2     scalar     array      RTOL*ABS(Y(i)) + ATOL(i)
C              3     array      scalar     RTOL(i)*ABS(Y(i)) + ATOL
C              4     array      array      RTOL(i)*ABS(Y(i)) + ATOL(i)
C
C          When either of these parameters is a scalar, it need not
C          be dimensioned in the user's calling program.
C
C          If none of the above choices (with ITOL, RTOL, and ATOL
C          fixed throughout the problem) is suitable, more general
C          error controls can be obtained by substituting
C          user-supplied routines for the setting of EWT and/or for
C          the norm calculation.  See Part iv below.
C
C          If global errors are to be estimated by making a repeated
C          run on the same problem with smaller tolerances, then all
C          components of RTOL and ATOL (i.e. of EWT) should be scaled
C          down uniformly.
C
C ITASK  = An index specifying the task to be performed.
C          Input only.  ITASK has the following values and meanings.
C          1  means normal computation of output values of y(t) at
C             t = TOUT (by overshooting and interpolating).
C          2  means take one step only and return.

C          3  means stop at the first internal mesh point at or

C             beyond t = TOUT and return.
C          4  means normal computation of output values of y(t) at
C             t = TOUT but without overshooting t = TCRIT.
C             TCRIT must be input as RWORK(1).  TCRIT may be equal to
C             or beyond TOUT, but not behind it in the direction of
C             integration.  This option is useful if the problem
C             has a singularity at or beyond t = TCRIT.
C          5  means take one step, without passing TCRIT, and return.
C             TCRIT must be input as RWORK(1).
C
C          Note..  If ITASK = 4 or 5 and the solver reaches TCRIT
C          (within roundoff), it will return T = TCRIT (exactly) to
C          indicate this (unless ITASK = 4 and TOUT comes before TCRIT,
C          in which case answers at T = TOUT are returned first).
C
C ISTATE = an index used for input and output to specify the
C          the state of the calculation.
C
C          In the input, the values of ISTATE are as follows.
C          1  means this is the first call for the problem
C             (initializations will be done).  See note below.
C          2  means this is not the first call, and the calculation
C             is to continue normally, with no change in any input
C             parameters except possibly TOUT and ITASK.
C             (If ITOL, RTOL, and/or ATOL are changed between calls
C             with ISTATE = 2, the new values will be used but not

C             tested for legality.)
C          3  means this is not the first call, and the
C             calculation is to continue normally, but with
C             a change in input parameters other than
C             TOUT and ITASK.  Changes are allowed in
C             NEQ, ITOL, RTOL, ATOL, IOPT, LRW, LIW, MF, ML, MU,

C             and any of the optional input except H0.
C             (See IWORK description for ML and MU.)

C          Note..  A preliminary call with TOUT = T is not counted
C          as a first call here, as no initialization or checking of
C          input is done.  (Such a call is sometimes useful to include
C          the initial conditions in the output.)
C          Thus the first call for which TOUT .ne. T requires
C          ISTATE = 1 in the input.
C
C          In the output, ISTATE has the following values and meanings.
C           1  means nothing was done, as TOUT was equal to T with
C              ISTATE = 1 in the input.
C           2  means the integration was performed successfully.
C          -1  means an excessive amount of work (more than MXSTEP
C              steps) was done on this call, before completing the
C              requested task, but the integration was otherwise
C              successful as far as T.  (MXSTEP is an optional input
C              and is normally 500.)  To continue, the user may
C              simply reset ISTATE to a value .gt. 1 and call again.
C              (The excess work step counter will be reset to 0.)
C              In addition, the user may increase MXSTEP to avoid
C              this error return.  (See optional input below.)
C          -2  means too much accuracy was requested for the precision
C              of the machine being used.  This was detected before
C              completing the requested task, but the integration
C              was successful as far as T.  To continue, the tolerance
C              parameters must be reset, and ISTATE must be set
C              to 3.  The optional output TOLSF may be used for this
C              purpose.  (Note.. If this condition is detected before
C              taking any steps, then an illegal input return
C              (ISTATE = -3) occurs instead.)
C          -3  means illegal input was detected, before taking any
C              integration steps.  See written message for details.
C              Note..  If the solver detects an infinite loop of calls
C              to the solver with illegal input, it will cause
C              the run to stop.
C          -4  means there were repeated error test failures on
C              one attempted step, before completing the requested
C              task, but the integration was successful as far as T.
C              The problem may have a singularity, or the input
C              may be inappropriate.
C          -5  means there were repeated convergence test failures on
C              one attempted step, before completing the requested
C              task, but the integration was successful as far as T.
C              This may be caused by an inaccurate Jacobian matrix,
C              if one is being used.
C          -6  means EWT(i) became zero for some i during the
C              integration.  Pure relative error control (ATOL(i)=0.0)
C              was requested on a variable which has now vanished.
C              The integration was successful as far as T.
C
C          Note..  Since the normal output value of ISTATE is 2,
C          it does not need to be reset for normal continuation.

C          Also, since a negative input value of ISTATE will be
C          regarded as illegal, a negative output value requires the
C          user to change it, and possibly other input, before
C          calling the solver again.
C
C IOPT   = An integer flag to specify whether or not any optional
C          input is being used on this call.  Input only.
C          The optional input is listed separately below.
C          IOPT = 0 means no optional input is being used.
C                   Default values will be used in all cases.
C          IOPT = 1 means optional input is being used.
C
C RWORK  = A real working array (double precision).
C          The length of RWORK must be at least
C             20 + NYH*(MAXORD + 1) + 3*NEQ + LWM    where
C          NYH    = the initial value of NEQ,
C          MAXORD = 12 (if METH = 1) or 5 (if METH = 2) (unless a
C                   smaller value is given as an optional input),
C          LWM = length of work space for matrix-related data..
C          LWM = 0             if MITER = 0,
C          LWM = 2*NEQ**2 + 2  if MITER = 1 or 2, and MF.gt.0,
C          LWM = NEQ**2 + 2    if MITER = 1 or 2, and MF.lt.0,
C          LWM = NEQ + 2       if MITER = 3,
C          LWM = (3*ML+2*MU+2)*NEQ + 2 if MITER = 4 or 5, and MF.gt.0,
C          LWM = (2*ML+MU+1)*NEQ + 2   if MITER = 4 or 5, and MF.lt.0.
C          (See the MF description for METH and MITER.)
C          Thus if MAXORD has its default value and NEQ is constant,
C          this length is..

C             20 + 16*NEQ                    for MF = 10,
C             22 + 16*NEQ + 2*NEQ**2         for MF = 11 or 12,
C             22 + 16*NEQ + NEQ**2           for MF = -11 or -12,
C             22 + 17*NEQ                    for MF = 13,
C             22 + 18*NEQ + (3*ML+2*MU)*NEQ  for MF = 14 or 15,
C             22 + 17*NEQ + (2*ML+MU)*NEQ    for MF = -14 or -15,
C             20 +  9*NEQ                    for MF = 20,
C             22 +  9*NEQ + 2*NEQ**2         for MF = 21 or 22,
C             22 +  9*NEQ + NEQ**2           for MF = -21 or -22,
C             22 + 10*NEQ                    for MF = 23,
C             22 + 11*NEQ + (3*ML+2*MU)*NEQ  for MF = 24 or 25.
C             22 + 10*NEQ + (2*ML+MU)*NEQ    for MF = -24 or -25.
C          The first 20 words of RWORK are reserved for conditional
C          and optional input and optional output.
C
C          The following word in RWORK is a conditional input..
C            RWORK(1) = TCRIT = critical value of t which the solver
C                       is not to overshoot.  Required if ITASK is
C                       4 or 5, and ignored otherwise.  (See ITASK.)
C
C LRW    = The length of the array RWORK, as declared by the user.

C          (This will be checked by the solver.)
C
C IWORK  = An integer work array.  The length of IWORK must be at least
C             30        if MITER = 0 or 3 (MF = 10, 13, 20, 23), or
C             30 + NEQ  otherwise (abs(MF) = 11,12,14,15,21,22,24,25).
C          The first 30 words of IWORK are reserved for conditional and
C          optional input and optional output.
C
C          The following 2 words in IWORK are conditional input..
C            IWORK(1) = ML     These are the lower and upper
C            IWORK(2) = MU     half-bandwidths, respectively, of the
C                       banded Jacobian, excluding the main diagonal.
C                       The band is defined by the matrix locations
C                       (i,j) with i-ML .le. j .le. i+MU.  ML and MU
C                       must satisfy  0 .le.  ML,MU  .le. NEQ-1.
C                       These are required if MITER is 4 or 5, and
C                       ignored otherwise.  ML and MU may in fact be
C                       the band parameters for a matrix to which
C                       df/dy is only approximately equal.
C
C LIW    = the length of the array IWORK, as declared by the user.
C          (This will be checked by the solver.)
C
C Note..  The work arrays must not be altered between calls to DVODE
C for the same problem, except possibly for the conditional and
C optional input, and except for the last 3*NEQ words of RWORK.
C The latter space is used for internal scratch space, and so is
C available for use by the user outside DVODE between calls, if
C desired (but not for use by F or JAC).
C
C JAC    = The name of the user-supplied routine (MITER = 1 or 4) to
C          compute the Jacobian matrix, df/dy, as a function of
C          the scalar t and the vector y.  It is to have the form
C               SUBROUTINE JAC (NEQ, T, Y, ML, MU, PD, NROWPD,
C                               RPAR, IPAR)
C               DOUBLE PRECISION T, Y, PD, RPAR
C               DIMENSION Y(NEQ), PD(NROWPD, NEQ)
C          where NEQ, T, Y, ML, MU, and NROWPD are input and the array
C          PD is to be loaded with partial derivatives (elements of the

C          Jacobian matrix) in the output.  PD must be given a first
C          dimension of NROWPD.  T and Y have the same meaning as in
C          Subroutine F.  (In the DIMENSION statement above, NEQ can
C          be replaced by  *  to make Y and PD assumed size arrays.)
C               In the full matrix case (MITER = 1), ML and MU are
C          ignored, and the Jacobian is to be loaded into PD in
C          columnwise manner, with df(i)/dy(j) loaded into PD(i,j).
C               In the band matrix case (MITER = 4), the elements
C          within the band are to be loaded into PD in columnwise
C          manner, with diagonal lines of df/dy loaded into the rows
C          of PD. Thus df(i)/dy(j) is to be loaded into PD(i-j+MU+1,j).
C          ML and MU are the half-bandwidth parameters. (See IWORK).
C          The locations in PD in the two triangular areas which
C          correspond to nonexistent matrix elements can be ignored
C          or loaded arbitrarily, as they are overwritten by DVODE.
C               JAC need not provide df/dy exactly.  A crude
C          approximation (possibly with a smaller bandwidth) will do.
C               In either case, PD is preset to zero by the solver,
C          so that only the nonzero elements need be loaded by JAC.
C          Each call to JAC is preceded by a call to F with the same
C          arguments NEQ, T, and Y.  Thus to gain some efficiency,
C          intermediate quantities shared by both calculations may be
C          saved in a user COMMON block by F and not recomputed by JAC,
C          if desired.  Also, JAC may alter the Y array, if desired.
C          JAC must be declared external in the calling program.
C               Subroutine JAC may access user-defined real and integer
C          work arrays, RPAR and IPAR, whose dimensions are set by the
C          user in the main program.
C
C MF     = The method flag.  Used only for input.  The legal values of
C          MF are 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25,
C          -11, -12, -14, -15, -21, -22, -24, -25.
C          MF is a signed two-digit integer, MF = JSV*(10*METH + MITER).
C          JSV = SIGN(MF) indicates the Jacobian-saving strategy..
C            JSV =  1 means a copy of the Jacobian is saved for reuse
C                     in the corrector iteration algorithm.
C            JSV = -1 means a copy of the Jacobian is not saved

C                     (valid only for MITER = 1, 2, 4, or 5).
C          METH indicates the basic linear multistep method..
C            METH = 1 means the implicit Adams method.
C            METH = 2 means the method based on backward
C                     differentiation formulas (BDF-s).
C          MITER indicates the corrector iteration method..
C            MITER = 0 means functional iteration (no Jacobian matrix
C                      is involved).
C            MITER = 1 means chord iteration with a user-supplied
C                      full (NEQ by NEQ) Jacobian.
C            MITER = 2 means chord iteration with an internally
C                      generated (difference quotient) full Jacobian
C                      (using NEQ extra calls to F per df/dy value).
C            MITER = 3 means chord iteration with an internally
C                      generated diagonal Jacobian approximation
C                      (using 1 extra call to F per df/dy evaluation).
C            MITER = 4 means chord iteration with a user-supplied
C                      banded Jacobian.
C            MITER = 5 means chord iteration with an internally
C                      generated banded Jacobian (using ML+MU+1 extra
C                      calls to F per df/dy evaluation).
C          If MITER = 1 or 4, the user must supply a subroutine JAC
C          (the name is arbitrary) as described above under JAC.
C          For other values of MITER, a dummy argument can be used.

C
C RPAR     User-specified array used to communicate real parameters
C          to user-supplied subroutines.  If RPAR is a vector, then
C          it must be dimensioned in the user's main program.  If it
C          is unused or it is a scalar, then it need not be
C          dimensioned.
C
C IPAR     User-specified array used to communicate integer parameter
C          to user-supplied subroutines.  The comments on dimensioning
C          RPAR apply to IPAR.
C-----------------------------------------------------------------------
C Optional Input.

C
C The following is a list of the optional input provided for in the
C call sequence.  (See also Part ii.)  For each such input variable,
C this table lists its name as used in this documentation, its
C location in the call sequence, its meaning, and the default value.
C The use of any of this input requires IOPT = 1, and in that
C case all of this input is examined.  A value of zero for any
C of these optional input variables will cause the default value to be
C used.  Thus to use a subset of the optional input, simply preload
C locations 5 to 10 in RWORK and IWORK to 0.0 and 0 respectively, and
C then set those of interest to nonzero values.
C
C NAME    LOCATION      MEANING AND DEFAULT VALUE
C
C H0      RWORK(5)  The step size to be attempted on the first step.

C                   The default value is determined by the solver.
C

C HMAX    RWORK(6)  The maximum absolute step size allowed.
C                   The default value is infinite.
C

C HMIN    RWORK(7)  The minimum absolute step size allowed.
C                   The default value is 0.  (This lower bound is not

C                   enforced on the final step before reaching TCRIT
C                   when ITASK = 4 or 5.)
C
C MAXORD  IWORK(5)  The maximum order to be allowed.  The default
C                   value is 12 if METH = 1, and 5 if METH = 2.
C                   If MAXORD exceeds the default value, it will
C                   be reduced to the default value.
C                   If MAXORD is changed during the problem, it may
C                   cause the current order to be reduced.
C
C MXSTEP  IWORK(6)  Maximum number of (internally defined) steps
C                   allowed during one call to the solver.
C                   The default value is 500.
C
C MXHNIL  IWORK(7)  Maximum number of messages printed (per problem)
C                   warning that T + H = T on a step (H = step size).
C                   This must be positive to result in a non-default
C                   value.  The default value is 10.
C
C-----------------------------------------------------------------------
C Optional Output.
C
C As optional additional output from DVODE, the variables listed
C below are quantities related to the performance of DVODE
C which are available to the user.  These are communicated by way of
C the work arrays, but also have internal mnemonic names as shown.
C Except where stated otherwise, all of this output is defined
C on any successful return from DVODE, and on any return with
C ISTATE = -1, -2, -4, -5, or -6.  On an illegal input return
C (ISTATE = -3), they will be unchanged from their existing values
C (if any), except possibly for TOLSF, LENRW, and LENIW.

C On any error return, output relevant to the error will be defined,
C as noted below.
C

C                   which the solver has actually reached, i.e. the
C                   current internal mesh point in t.  In the output,
C                   TCUR will always be at least as far from the
C                   initial value of t as the current argument T,
C                   but may be farther (if interpolation was done).
C
C TOLSF   RWORK(14) A tolerance scale factor, greater than 1.0,
C                   computed when a request for too much accuracy was
C                   detected (ISTATE = -3 if detected at the start of
C                   the problem, ISTATE = -2 otherwise).  If ITOL is

C                   left unaltered but RTOL and ATOL are uniformly
C                   scaled up by a factor of TOLSF for the next call,
C                   then the solver is deemed likely to succeed.
C                   (The user may also ignore TOLSF and alter the
C                   tolerance parameters in any other way appropriate.)
C

C
C NQCUR   IWORK(15) The order to be attempted on the next step.
C
C IMXER   IWORK(16) The index of the component of largest magnitude in
C                   the weighted local error vector ( e(i)/EWT(i) ),
C                   on an error return with ISTATE = -4 or -5.
C
C LENRW   IWORK(17) The length of RWORK actually required.
C                   This is defined on normal returns and on an illegal
C                   input return for insufficient storage.
C
C LENIW   IWORK(18) The length of IWORK actually required.
C                   This is defined on normal returns and on an illegal
C                   input return for insufficient storage.

C                   solver so far.
C
C NETF    IWORK(22) The number of error test failures of the integrator
C                   so far.
C
C The following two arrays are segments of the RWORK array which
C may also be of interest to the user as optional output.
C For each array, the table below gives its internal name,
C its base address in RWORK, and its description.
C
C NAME    BASE ADDRESS      DESCRIPTION
C
C YH      21             The Nordsieck history array, of size NYH by
C                        (NQCUR + 1), where NYH is the initial value
C                        of NEQ.  For j = 0,1,...,NQCUR, column j+1
C                        of YH contains HCUR**j/factorial(j) times
C                        the j-th derivative of the interpolating
C                        polynomial currently representing the

C
C ACOR     LENRW-NEQ+1   Array of size NEQ used for the accumulated

C                        to represent the estimated local error in Y
C                        on the last step.  This is the vector e in
C                        the description of the error control.  It is

C                        defined only on a successful return from DVODE.
C
C-----------------------------------------------------------------------
C Interrupting and Restarting
C
C If the integration of a given problem by DVODE is to be
C interrrupted and then later continued, such as when restarting
C an interrupted run or alternating between two or more ODE problems,
C the user should save, following the return from the last DVODE call
C prior to the interruption, the contents of the call sequence
C variables and internal COMMON blocks, and later restore these
C values before the next DVODE call for that problem.  To save
C and restore the COMMON blocks, use subroutine DVSRCO, as
C described below in part ii.
C
C In addition, if non-default values for either LUN or MFLAG are
C desired, an extra call to XSETUN and/or XSETF should be made just
C before continuing the integration.  See Part ii below for details.
C
C-----------------------------------------------------------------------
C Part ii.  Other Routines Callable.
C
C The following are optional calls which the user may make to
C gain additional capabilities in conjunction with DVODE.
C (The routines XSETUN and XSETF are designed to conform to the
C SLATEC error handling package.)
C
C     FORM OF CALL                  FUNCTION
C  CALL XSETUN(LUN)           Set the logical unit number, LUN, for
C                             output of messages from DVODE, if
C                             the default is not desired.
C                             The default value of LUN is 6.
C
C  CALL XSETF(MFLAG)          Set a flag to control the printing of
C                             messages by DVODE.
C                             MFLAG = 0 means do not print. (Danger..
C                             This risks losing valuable information.)
C                             MFLAG = 1 means print (the default).
C
C                             Either of the above calls may be made at
C                             any time and will take effect immediately.
C

C  CALL DVSRCO(RSAV,ISAV,JOB) Saves and restores the contents of
C                             the internal COMMON blocks used by

C                             DVODE. (See Part iii below.)
C                             RSAV must be a real array of length 49
C                             or more, and ISAV must be an integer
C                             array of length 40 or more.
C                             JOB=1 means save COMMON into RSAV/ISAV.
C                             JOB=2 means restore COMMON from RSAV/ISAV.
C                                DVSRCO is useful if one is
C                             interrupting a run and restarting
C                             later, or alternating between two or
C                             more problems solved with DVODE.
C
C  CALL DVINDY(,,,,,)         Provide derivatives of y, of various
C        (See below.)         orders, at a specified point T, if
C                             desired.  It may be called only after
C                             a successful return from DVODE.
C
C The detailed instructions for using DVINDY are as follows.
C The form of the call is..
C
C  CALL DVINDY (T, K, RWORK(21), NYH, DKY, IFLAG)
C
C The input parameters are..
C
C T         = Value of independent variable where answers are desired
C             (normally the same as the T last returned by DVODE).
C             For valid results, T must lie between TCUR - HU and TCUR.
C             (See optional output for TCUR and HU.)

C K         = Integer order of the derivative desired.  K must satisfy
C             0 .le. K .le. NQCUR, where NQCUR is the current order
C             (see optional output).  The capability corresponding
C             to K = 0, i.e. computing y(T), is already provided
C             by DVODE directly.  Since NQCUR .ge. 1, the first
C             derivative dy/dt is always available with DVINDY.
C RWORK(21) = The base address of the history array YH.
C NYH       = Column length of YH, equal to the initial value of NEQ.
C
C The output parameters are..
C
C DKY       = A real array of length NEQ containing the computed value
C             of the K-th derivative of y(t).
C IFLAG     = Integer flag, returned as 0 if K and T were legal,
C             -1 if K was illegal, and -2 if T was illegal.
C             On an error return, a message is also written.
C-----------------------------------------------------------------------
C Part iii.  COMMON Blocks.
C If DVODE is to be used in an overlay situation, the user
C must declare, in the primary overlay, the variables in..
C   (1) the call sequence to DVODE,
C   (2) the two internal COMMON blocks
C         /DVOD01/  of length  81  (48 double precision words
C                         followed by 33 integer words),
C         /DVOD02/  of length  9  (1 double precision word
C                         followed by 8 integer words),
C

C If DVODE is used on a system in which the contents of internal
C COMMON blocks are not preserved between calls, the user should
C declare the above two COMMON blocks in his main program to insure
C that their contents are preserved.
C
C-----------------------------------------------------------------------
C Part iv.  Optionally Replaceable Solver Routines.
C
C Below are descriptions of two routines in the DVODE package which
C relate to the measurement of errors.  Either routine can be
C replaced by a user-supplied version, if desired.  However, since such
C a replacement may have a major impact on performance, it should be
C done only when absolutely necessary, and only with great caution.
C (Note.. The means by which the package version of a routine is


C superseded by the user's version may be system-dependent.)
C

C (a) DEWSET.
C The following subroutine is called just before each internal
C integration step, and sets the array of error weights, EWT, as
C described under ITOL/RTOL/ATOL above..

C     SUBROUTINE DEWSET (NEQ, ITOL, RTOL, ATOL, YCUR, EWT)
C where NEQ, ITOL, RTOL, and ATOL are as in the DVODE call sequence,
C YCUR contains the current dependent variable vector, and
C EWT is the array of weights set by DEWSET.
C
C If the user supplies this subroutine, it must return in EWT(i)
C (i = 1,...,NEQ) a positive quantity suitable for comparison with
C errors in Y(i).  The EWT array returned by DEWSET is passed to the
C DVNORM routine (See below.), and also used by DVODE in the computation
C of the optional output IMXER, the diagonal Jacobian approximation,
C and the increments for difference quotient Jacobians.
C
C In the user-supplied version of DEWSET, it may be desirable to use
C the current values of derivatives of y.  Derivatives up to order NQ
C are available from the history array YH, described above under
C Optional Output.  In DEWSET, YH is identical to the YCUR array,
C extended to NQ + 1 columns with a column length of NYH and scale
C factors of h**j/factorial(j).  On the first call for the problem,
C given by NST = 0, NQ is 1 and H is temporarily set to 1.0.
C NYH is the initial value of NEQ.  The quantities NQ, H, and NST
C can be obtained by including in DEWSET the statements..
C     DOUBLE PRECISION RVOD, H, HU
C     COMMON /DVOD01/ RVOD(48), IVOD(33)
C     COMMON /DVOD02/ HU, NCFN, NETF, NFE, NJE, NLU, NNI, NQU, NST

C     NQ = IVOD(28)
C     H = RVOD(21)
C Thus, for example, the current value of dy/dt can be obtained as
C YCUR(NYH+i)/H  (i=1,...,NEQ)  (and the division by H is
C unnecessary when NST = 0).
C
C (b) DVNORM.
C The following is a real function routine which computes the weighted
C root-mean-square norm of a vector v..
C     D = DVNORM (N, V, W)
C where..

C   N = the length of the vector,
C   V = real array of length N containing the vector,
C   W = real array of length N containing weights,

C   D = sqrt( (1/N) * sum(V(i)*W(i))**2 ).
C DVNORM is called with N = NEQ and with W(i) = 1.0/EWT(i), where
C EWT is as set by subroutine DEWSET.

C
C If the user supplies this function, it should return a non-negative
C value of DVNORM suitable for use in the error control in DVODE.
C None of the arguments should be altered by DVNORM.
C For example, a user-supplied DVNORM routine might..
C   -substitute a max-norm of (V(i)*W(i)) for the rms-norm, or
C   -ignore some components of V in the norm, with the effect of
C    suppressing the error control on those components of Y.
C-----------------------------------------------------------------------
C Other Routines in the DVODE Package.
C
C In addition to subroutine DVODE, the DVODE package includes the
C following subroutines and function routines..
C  DVHIN     computes an approximate step size for the initial step.
C  DVINDY    computes an interpolated value of the y vector at t = TOUT.
C  DVSTEP    is the core integrator, which does one step of the
C            integration and the associated error control.

C  DVJAC     computes and preprocesses the Jacobian matrix J = df/dy
C            and the Newton iteration matrix P = I - (h/l1)*J.

C  DVSOL     manages solution of linear system in chord iteration.

C  DVJUST    adjusts the history array on a change of order.
C  DEWSET    sets the error weight vector EWT before each step.

C  DVSRCO    is a user-callable routines to save and restore
C            the contents of the internal COMMON blocks.

C DVINDY computes interpolated values of the K-th derivative of the
C dependent variable vector y, and stores it in DKY.  This routine
C is called within the package with K = 0 and T = TOUT, but may
C also be called by the user for any K up to the current order.
C (See detailed instructions in the usage documentation.)
C-----------------------------------------------------------------------
C The computed values in DKY are gotten by interpolation using the
C Nordsieck history array YH.  This array corresponds uniquely to a
C vector-valued polynomial of degree NQCUR or less, and DKY is set
C to the K-th derivative of this polynomial at T.
C The formula for DKY is..
C              q
C  DKY(i)  =  sum  c(j,K) * (T - TN)**(j-K) * H**(-j) * YH(i,j+1)
C             j=K
C where  c(j,K) = j*(j-1)*...*(j-K+1), q = NQCUR, TN = TCUR, H = HCUR.
C The quantities  NQ = NQCUR, L = NQ+1, N, TN, and H are
C communicated by COMMON.  The above sum is done in reverse order.
C IFLAG is returned negative if either K or T is out of bounds.

C DVSTEP performs one step of the integration of an initial value
C problem for a system of ordinary differential equations.
C DVSTEP calls subroutine VNLS for the solution of the nonlinear system
C arising in the time step.  Thus it is independent of the problem
C Jacobian structure and the type of nonlinear system solution method.
C DVSTEP returns a completion flag KFLAG (in COMMON).
C A return with KFLAG = -1 or -2 means either ABS(H) = HMIN or 10
C consecutive failures occurred.  On a return with KFLAG negative,
C the values of TN and the YH array are as of the beginning of the last

C step, and H is the last step size attempted.
C
C Communication with DVSTEP is done with the following variables..
C
C Y      = An array of length N used for the dependent variable vector.
C YH     = An LDYH by LMAX array containing the dependent variables
C          and their approximate scaled derivatives, where
C          LMAX = MAXORD + 1.  YH(i,j+1) contains the approximate
C          j-th derivative of y(i), scaled by H**j/factorial(j)
C          (j = 0,1,...,NQ).  On entry for the first step, the first
C          two columns of YH must be set from the initial values.
C LDYH   = A constant integer .ge. N, the first dimension of YH.
C          N is the number of ODEs in the system.
C YH1    = A one-dimensional array occupying the same space as YH.

C EWT    = An array of length N containing multiplicative weights
C          for local error measurements.  Local errors in y(i) are
C          compared to 1.0/EWT(i) in various error tests.
C SAVF   = An array of working storage, of length N.


C          also used for input of YH(*,MAXORD+2) when JSTART = -1
C          and MAXORD .lt. the current order NQ.
C VSAV   = A work array of length N passed to subroutine VNLS.
C ACOR   = A work array of length N, used for the accumulated
C          corrections.  On a successful return, ACOR(i) contains
C          the estimated one-step local error in y(i).
C WM,IWM = Real and integer work arrays associated with matrix
C          operations in VNLS.
C F      = Dummy name for the user supplied subroutine for f.
C JAC    = Dummy name for the user supplied Jacobian subroutine.
C PSOL   = Dummy name for the subroutine passed to VNLS, for
C          possible use there.
C VNLS   = Dummy name for the nonlinear system solving subroutine,
C          whose real name is dependent on the method used.
C RPAR, IPAR = Dummy names for user's real and integer work arrays.

C   TQ     = A vector of length 5 in which vset stores constants
C            used for the convergence test, the error test, and the
C            selection of H at a new order.
C   METH   = The basic method indicator.
C   NQ     = The current order.
C   L      = NQ + 1, the length of the vector stored in EL, and
C            the number of columns of the YH array being used.
C   NQWAIT = A counter controlling the frequency of order changes.

C If JSV = 1 and MITER = 1, 2, 4, or 5, and if the saved value of J is

C Subroutines XERRWD, XSETF, XSETUN, and the two function routines
C MFLGSV and LUNSAV, as given here, constitute a simplified version of
C the SLATEC error handling package.

C Written by A. C. Hindmarsh and P. N. Brown at LLNL.

C Version of 13 April, 1989.
C This version is in double precision.
C
C All arguments are input arguments.
C
C MSG    = The message (character array).
C NMES   = The length of MSG (number of characters).
C NERR   = The error number (not used).

C LEVEL  = The error level..
C          0 or 1 means recoverable (control returns to caller).
C          2 means fatal (run is aborted--see note below).
C NI     = Number of integers (0, 1, or 2) to be printed with message.
C I1,I2  = Integers to be printed, depending on NI.
C NR     = Number of reals (0, 1, or 2) to be printed with message.
C R1,R2  = Reals to be printed, depending on NR.
C

C Note..  this routine is machine-dependent and specialized for use

C in limited context, in the following ways..
C 1. The argument MSG is assumed to be of type CHARACTER, and
C    the message is printed with a format of (1X,80A1).
C 2. The message is assumed to take only one line.
C    Multi-line messages are generated by repeated calls.
C 3. If LEVEL = 2, control passes to the statement   STOP
C    to abort the run.  This statement may be machine-dependent.
C 4. R1 and R2 are assumed to be in double precision and are printed
C    in D21.13 format.
C
C For a different default logical unit number, change the data

C statement in function routine LUNSAV.
C For a different run-abort command, change the statement following
C statement 100 at the end.

c psi contains the likelihood vectors for each subject - the i-th
c row of psi is likelikhood vector for subject i.  Thus psi(i,j) is
c likelihood of the j-th point for c the i-th subject.  The input value

*
*  Purpose
*  =======
*
*  DPOTRF computes the Cholesky factorization of a real symmetric
*  positive definite matrix A.
*
*  The factorization has the form
*     A = U**T * U,  if UPLO = 'U', or
*     A = L  * L**T,  if UPLO = 'L',
*  where U is an upper triangular matrix and L is lower triangular.

*
*  This is the block version of the algorithm, calling Level 3 BLAS.
*
*  Arguments
*  =========
*
*  UPLO    (input) CHARACTER*1
*          = 'U':  Upper triangle of A is stored;
*          = 'L':  Lower triangle of A is stored.
*

*  N       (input) INTEGER

*          The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.
*
*  A       (input/output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDA,N)
*          On entry, the symmetric matrix A.  If UPLO = 'U', the leading
*          N-by-N upper triangular part of A contains the upper
*          triangular part of the matrix A, and the strictly lower
*          triangular part of A is not referenced.  If UPLO = 'L', the
*          leading N-by-N lower triangular part of A contains the lower
*          triangular part of the matrix A, and the strictly upper
*          triangular part of A is not referenced.
*
*          On exit, if INFO = 0, the factor U or L from the Cholesky
*          factorization A = U**T*U or A = L*L**T.
*
*  LDA     (input) INTEGER
*          The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA >= max(1,N).
*
*  INFO    (output) INTEGER
*          = 0:  successful exit
*          < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value

*          > 0:  if INFO = i, the leading minor of order i is not
*                positive definite, and the factorization could not be
*                completed.

*
*  Installers may consider modifying the STOP statement in order to
*  call system-specific exception-handling facilities.
*
*  Arguments

      COMMON/ERR/ERRFIL

C  SUBROUTINE NEWWORK1 (BASED ON THE STAND-A-LONE VERSION OF THE SAME
C  NAME) READS IN A WORKING COPY PATIENT DATA FILE, AND OUTPUTS ANOTHER
C  FILE WHICH IS:

C  a. EXACTLY THE SAME IF THE ORIGINAL FILE HAS NO STEADY STATE DOSE
C     INDICATORS;

C  OR

C  b. ALTERED TO HAVE THE SAME INFO AS IN THE ORIGINAL FILE, BUT ALSO
C     CONTAINING AN EXTRA 100 DOSES FOR EACH STEADY STATE DOSE 
C     INDICATOR.

C  NOTES:

C  1. A STEADY STATE DOSE INDICATOR IS A NEGATIVE VALUE IN THE TIME
C  ENTRY FOR A DOSE. THIS IS ACCOMPANIED BY INFORMATION ON THE SET OF
C  DOSES IN THE IV AND BOLUS ENTRIES, AS THE FOLLOWING EXAMPLE SHOWS:

C   Time    IV     Bolus
C   -2.0   100.0   150.0 ...

C  THE ABOVE LINE WOULD TELL THE PROGRAM:

C  a. THAT THIS WAS INFO ON 100 STEADY STATE DOSES BECAUSE OF THE 
C     NEGATIVE TIME VALUE;
C  b. THE TIME BETWEEN CONSECUTIVE IV START TIMES = 2 HOURS, BECAUSE 
C     THIS IS THE ABS. VALUE OF THE TIME;
C  C. THE IV RATE = 100MG/HOUR;
C  D. THE TOTAL DRUG AMT. FOR EACH IV DOSE IS 150MG.

C  SO THE PROGRAM WOULD THEN ADD 100 DOSES TO THE PATIENT DATA FILE,
C  STARTING AT T = 0, EACH WITH AN IV RATE = 100, AND CONTINUING FOR
C  1.5 HOURS.

C  2. IT WILL BE ASSUMED THAT EACH STEADY STATE DOSE INDICATOR ALWAYS
C  WILL BE REPLACED BY 100 IV DOSES (NOT BOLUS DOSES).
C  AS OF npageng17.f, STEADY STATE DOSES MAY BE BOLUS DOSES. IN THIS
C  CASE, THE IV RATE WILL BE 0.0 OF COURSE.

C  3. ALL OTHER TIMES IN THE PATIENT DATA FILE (UP TO THE NEXT TIME 
C  RESET IF THERE IS ONE) WILL BE ASSUMED TO BE TIMES FROM THE END OF 
C  THE 100TH DOSE INTERVAL. IN THE ABOVE EXAMPLE, THE 100TH DOSE 
C  INTERVAL WOULD END AT T = 200 (THE LAST IV ITSELF WOULD END AT 
C  T = 199.5, BUT THE 100TH DOSE INTERVAL WOULD END AT T = 200). SO ALL
C  OTHER TIMES IN THE DOSAGE AND OBSERVATION BLOCKS WOULD HAVE 200 ADDED
C  TO THEIR VALUES.

C  4. THE ABOVE EXAMPLE IS FOR ONE DRUG ONLY, BUT ANY OR ALL OF THE
C  NDRUGS IN A PATIENT'S FILE CAN HAVE STEADY STATE DOSES. ANY DRUG
C  WHICH HAS A NON-0 VALUE IN THE BOLUS COLUMN OF A STEADY STATE DOSE
C  LINE (I.E., ONE WITH TIME < 0) WILL PARTICIPATE IN A STEADY STATE
C  DOSE SET, GETTING THAT AMOUNT OF DRUG IN EACH OF THE 100 DOSES. IF
C  THE IV COLUMN IS > 0, THEN THE DRUG WILL BE GIVEN AT THE RATE 
C  SHOWN IN THE IV COLUMN. IF THE IV COLUMN IS 0, THEN THE DRUG WILL
C  BE GIVEN AS A BOLUS.

C  5. THE 100 STEADY STATE DOSES CAN BE GIVEN AS THE FIRST SET OF DOSES
C  IN A PATIENT'S FILE, AS INDICATED ABOVE, OR AT ANY TIME RESET. IF
C  THEY ARE AT A TIME RESET, ALL THE SUBSEQUENT TIMES AFTER THAT TIME
C  RESET (UP TO THE NEXT TIME RESET IF THERE IS ONE) ARE ADJUSTED AS 
C  INDICATED ABOVE TO BE TIMES AFTER THE END OF THAT SET OF 100 DOSES.

C  NPAGFULLA11 HAS THE FOLLOWING CHANGES TO NPAGFULL11:

C  1. JUST AFTER THE REWIND(27) STATEMENT, SUBROUTINE NEWWORK1 IS 
C  CALLED TO READ THE PATIENT DATA FROM FILE 27, AND CONVERT IT TO
C  PATIENT DATA ON FILE 37, WITH EACH STEADY STATE DOSE INDICATOR
C  RESULTING IN AN EXTRA 100 DOSE SETS (WITH THE NEGATIVE DOSE TIME
C  LEFT IN - SEE COMMENTS BELOW). NOTE THAT THIS SUBROUTINE NEWWORK1
C  IS THE SAME AS IN THE CURRENT NPAG "ENGINE" MODULE, npageng25.f,
C  EXCEPT IT READS FILE 27 AND WRITES TO FILE 37, RATHER THAN READING
C  FROM FILE 23 AND WRITING TO FILE 27; ARRAY TIMOBREL IS NOT
C  ESTABLISHED IN NEWWORK1, AND NOT PASSED AS AN ARGUMENT (IT IS NOT
C  NEEDED IN THIS PROGRAM); MAXSUB IS ALSO NOT PASSED AS AN 
C  ARGUMENT (IT IS NOT NEEDED); NSUB IS NOT PASSED AS AN ARGUMENT (IT
C  IS NOT NEEDED); AND COMMON/DOSEOBS AND THE ARRAYS IN IT ARE DELETED
C  (THEY ARE NOT NEEDED).

C  NOTE THAT SUBROUTINE NEWWORK1 IS INCLUDED IN THE NPAGFULLA MODULE.

C  2. IF THE PROGRAM BOMBS, THE MESSAGE THAT IS WRITTEN TO THE SCREEN
C  WILL NOW ALSO BE WRITTEN TO THE FILE ERRFIL = ERRORxxxx, WHERE xxxx
C  IS THE 4-DIGIT RUN NO. IN THIS WAY, IF THE PROGRAM IS BEING RUN USING
C  Pmetrics, THE Pmetrics PROGRAM CAN RESPOND APPROPRIATELY. NOTE THAT
C  ERRFIL IS PASSED TO ALL THE ROUTINES WHICH COULD WRITE TO IT
C  USING COMMON/ERR/ERRFIL.

C  3. THE MAXIMUM NO. OF OUTPUT EQUATIONS WILL BE CHANGED FROM 6 TO 7,
C  AND TO FACILITATE ANY FUTURE SUCH CHANGES, THIS NUMBER WILL BE SET
C  = MAXNUMEQ (SO ONLY THE PARAMETER STATEMENT WILL HAVE TO BE CHANGED
C  IN THE FUTURE). RATHER THAN PASS MAXNUMEQ TO ALL THE RELEVANT 
C  SUBROUTINES (AS IS DONE IN NPAG113.FOR AND IT2B110.FOR), THIS 
C  PROGRAM WILL JUST HAVE MAXNUMEQ SET IN A PARAMETER STATEMENT IN ALL
C  THESE ROUTINES. AND NOTE THAT IN THOSE SUBROUTINES, ANY 6
C  REFERRING TO THE MAX. NO. OF OUTPUT EQUATIONS WILL BE CHANGED TO
C  MAXNUMEQ.

C  4. COMMON/OBSER IN MAIN IS REMOVED. IT WASN'T NEEDED. SIMILARLY
C  ALL THE ARRAYS IN THIS COMMON ARE NO LONGER DIMENSIONED.

C  5. FORMATS 2345 AND 2346 NOW CORRECTLY REFER TO SUBROUTINE
C  NPAGFULL1, RATHER THAN NPAGFULL.

C  NPAGFULL11.FOR                                       8/06/13

C  NPAGFULL11 HAS THE FOLLOWING CHANGE2 FROM NPAGFULL1:
C  1. INSTEAD OF SELELCTING ALL GRID PTS. WHOSE PROBALITIES ARE WITHIN
C  1.D-10 OF THE HIGHEST, THIS PROGRAM TAKES ALL POINTS WHOSE PROBS ARE
C  WITHIN 1.D-100 OF THE HIGHEST.

C  SEE THE "IF(MAXCYC .EQ. 0) THEN" CODE NEAR THE END OF MAIN.

C  2. THE MAIN SUBROUTINE IS RENAMED NPAGFULL11 (INSTEAD OF NPAGFULL).

C  3. ALL SUBROUTINES OTHER THAN THE MAIN ONE ARE REMOVED SINCE THEY
C  ARE ALREADY IN NPAGFULL.FOR, WHICH WILL ALSO BE LINKED TO
C  BESTDOSTEMP.FOR (TO BE RENAMED BESTDOS112.FOR)

C  4. MAXCYC IS REMOVED FROM THE ARGUMENT LIST SINCE IT IS HARDCODED
C  TO BE 0 BELOW.

C  NPAGFULL1.FOR                                        6/30/13

C  NPAGFULL1 HAS THE FOLLOWING CHANGES TO NPAGFULL:

C - MAXCYC IS MANUALLY SET = 0, SO THE VALUE INPUT IN THE ARGUMENT 
C   STATEMENT IS UNIMPORTANT. 
C - AFTER LOOP 800, CONTROL GOES TO LABEL 900 IF MAXCYC = 0. SO THIS 
C   IS SIMILAR CODE TO npageng24.f, IN THAT IF MAXCYC = 0, NO CYCLE 
C   CALCS. ARE DONE --> SUBROUTINE emint IS NEVER CALLED.
C - AT LABEL 900, IF MAXCYC = 0 (WHICH OF COURSE IT IS), THEN THE
C   REMAINING CODE (FROM SUBROUTINE SUBRES OF npageng24.f) IS USED
C   TO FINISH CALCULATING THE BAYESIAN POSTERIOR OF THE SUBJECT.
C   AND THIS NEW CORDEN IS RETURNED TO THE MAIN BESTDOS MODULE.

C------------------------------------------------------------------

C  NPAGFULL.FOR                                            3/26/13

C  NPAGFULL IS BASED ON THE npageng22.f PROGRAM. IT RUNS AN NPAG
C  ANALYSIS IN ORDER TO OBTAIN THE FULL POSTERIOR DENSITY OF A SUBJECT
C  GIVEN AN APRIORI DENSITY. ALL OTHER CODE IN npageng22.f IS 
C  REMOVED (E.G., ALL EXTRA CALCULATIONS, ALL WRITING TO FILES, ETC.).

C  NOTE THAT ALL INFO NEEDED BY THIS ROUTINE IS INCLUDED IN THE 
C  CALLING ARGUMENTS; IN PARTICULAR, npag102.inp IS NOT READ.

C  THIS COMPARES TO NPAGBAY, WHICH CALCULATED THE 0-CYCLE BAYESIAN 
C  POSTERIOR OF THE SUBJECT.

C  NOTE ALSO THAT ALL DIMENSIONS OF 500 RELATED TO DOSE EVENTS HAVE BEEN
C  CHANGE TO 5000.

c  npageng22.f                                             11/8/12

c  npageng22 has the following change from npageng21:

c  1. It comments out the PAUSE statement following Format 164 in 
c  Subroutine emint. Reason: the program will not complete properly if 
c  it is run under  Pmetrics (which cannot supply a keyboard response
c  during a run). 

c  2. Formats 1657 and 7124 are changed to show that the output file
c  is made by npageng22 rather than npageng21.

c  See npageng22.f code for all the comments from npageng21.f back

c  As of npageng18.f, save CORDEN to CORDLAST AND NACTVE TO NACTLAST.
c  The reason is that if, somewhere during the next cycle's calculations

c  singular, then IHESS will be set = -1, and the program will stop.
c  And in this case, the program must be able to write out all of the

c  shift9 has the following subtle change from shift8:

c  In step 4, the logic to assign the bolus time, BOL(I,IND,1) is
c  simplified in the case where a steady state dose set begins as a
c  time reset event. In this case, the bolus time will be TAU(I) only
c  if both TAU(I) and the bolus value (RR) are not 0. See the reason
c  in the code.

c  shift8.f                                                9/20/12

c  shift8 has changes from shift7 in Step 4 to correct the code in the
c  case where bolus inputs are used in steady state dose sets. In 
c  shift7.f, a timelag for a bolus which was part of a steady state
c  dose set would not be applied properly. Now it will.

c-----------------------------------------------------------------------

c  shift7.f                                                11/6/11

c  shift7 differs from shift6 as follows:

c  1. The dimensions related to the no. of dose events are changed from
c  500 to 5000. This is needed as shift7 is compiled with idm1x7.f, 
c  idm2x7.f, and idm3x7.f (part of the npageng16.f "engine"), which
c  accommodates steady state dose sets.

c  2. 3 lines testing for IF(SIG(IDOSE) .EQ. 0 .AND. IDOSE .GT. 1)
c  are replaced by 	  IF(SIG(IDOSE) .LE. 0 .AND. IDOSE .GT. 1)
c  since now a dose reset occurs when a dose time is 0 (a regular
c  time reset) or < 0 (a time reset occurring with a steady state
c  dose set indicator).

C  SHIFT6.F                                                4/26/11

C  SHIFT5 HAS THE FOLLOWING CHANGES TO SHIFT5:

C  WT AND CCR ARE NO LONGER ASSUMED TO BE SPECIAL COVARIATES IN EACH
C  PATIENT'S WORKING COPY PATIENT DATA FILE. SO ALL DO LOOPS THAT 
C  START WITH  DO I = 1, 2+NADD ARE CHANGED TO START WITH DO I = 1,NADD,
C  BUT ONLY IF NADD .GT. 0.

C-----------------------------------------------------------------------

C  SHIFT5.F							9/11/09

C  SHIFT5 HAS THE FOLLOWING CHANGES TO SHIFT4.F.


C  THE ARGUMENT LIST CONTAINS TAU(.) RATHER THAN NTLAG(.). THIS
C  MEANS THAT TAU(I) IS INPUT DIRECTLY AS THE TIMELAG FOR DRUG I.
C  I.E., IT NO LONGER HAS TO BE CALCULATED AS A FUNCTION OF THE
C  PARAMETER ARRAY, P. BECAUSE OF THIS, P IS REMOVED FROM THE ARGUMENT
C  LIST AND THE DIMENSION STATEMENT. ALSO, NTLAG IS REMOVED FROM 
C  THT DIMENSION STATEMENT.

C  THE FIRST SET OF ID MODULES TO CALL SHIFT5.F ARE idm1x3.f, 
C  idm2x3.f, AND idm3x3.f

C-----------------------------------------------------------------------

C  SHIFT4.FOR							9/1/09

C  SHIFT4 HAS THE FOLLOWING CHANGES FROM SHIFT3:

C  1. NTLAG(I) CAN NOW BE NEGATIVE. IF THIS OCCURS, IT MEANS THAT THE
C  TIMELAG PARAMETER FOR DRUG I WILL BE EXP(P(-NTLAG(I)).

C  2. A BUG IS CORRECTED RELATED TO TIME "RESETS". PREVIOUSLY, IF THE
C  USER HAD A TIME "RESET" IN HIS DOSAGE REGIMEN, THIS ROUTINE WOULD
C  NOT WORK. THE REASON IS THAT IN THE CODE BELOW, EACH NEXT TIME
C  FOR AN IV, COVARIATE, OR BOLUS IS COMPARED TO THE PREVIOUSLY
C  ESTABLISHED TIME IN THE DOSAGE ARRAY (TIMNXT) AND IS A CANDIDATE
C  TO BE THE NEXT TIMNXT IF IT IS .GE. TIMNXT. SO IF A TIME RESET
C  VALUE OF 0 OCCURS, IT WILL NEVER BE A CANDIATE SINCE IT IS NOT
C  .GE. THE LAST TIMNXT. TO FIX THIS, AND MAKE SURE THAT A TIME
C  RESET VALUE OF 0 IS INCLUDED IN THE ADJUSTED DOSAGE BLOCK, THE
C  CODE WILL ADD TO EACH IV, BOLUS, AND COVARIATE ARRAY AN EXTRA
C  LINE WHEN A TIME RESET OCCURS. THIS LINE WILL HAVE A TIME OF
C  1.D19 (I.E., A LARGE VALUE WHICH REPRSENTS INFINITY); AND IT
C  WILL BE FOLLOWED BY A LINE WITH THE ADJUSTED RESET TIME (0 FOR
C  IVs AND COVARIATES, AND 0 + TAU(I) FOR BOLI.

C  TAU(I) =  THE VALUE OF THE TIMELAG FOR DRUG I.
C  ND = ORIGINAL NO. OF DOSE EVENTS. 
C  SIG(I) = TIME FOR ITH DOSE EVENT IN THE ORIGINAL DOSAGE REGIMEN,
C           I=1,ND.
C  NDRUG = NO. OF DRUGS (EACH HAS AN IV, FOLLOWED BY A BOLUS COLUMN).
C  NADD = NO. OF ADDITIONAL COVARIATES (EACH IS IN ITS OWN COLUMN
C         FOLLOWING THE IV/BOLUS COLUMNS.
C  RS(I,J) = "RATE" J FOR THE ITH DOSE EVENT IN THE ORIGINAL DOSAGE
C            REGIMEN; J=1,NI, I=1,ND, WHERE NI = 2*NDRUG + NADD
C            BECAUSE THE "RATES" CONTAIN, IN ORDER, 2 ENTRIES FOR
C            EACH DRUG (1 FOR THE IV AND 1 FOR THE BOLUS) AND 1 EACH
C            FOR THE NADD ADDITIONAL COVARIATES.

C  ND, SIG, RS, AS ABOVE, EXCEPT FOR THE ALTERED DOSAGE REGIMEN.

C-----------------------------------------------------------------------

C  SHIFT2.FOR							11-16-99

C  SHIFT2 HAS THE FOLLOWING CHANGE FROM SHIFT. AT THE END OF THE 
C  FORMATION OF ARRAY XMAT, ALL ROWS WHICH HAVE 0 BOLUS INPUT AND THE
C  SAME OTHER DATA VALUES (EXCEPT TIME) AS THE PREVIOUS ROW ARE NOT
C  USED IN THE NEW ARRAY XMAT2 WHICH HAS ONLY NON-REDUNDANT ROWS.
C  THIS, THEORETICALLY, SHOULDN'T HAVE ANY EFFECT ON CALCULATIONS, BUT 
C  NUMERICALLY IT DOES SINCE WHEN THE DVODE ROUTINE SOLVES D.E.'S, IT 
C  INTEGRATES OVER DIFFERENT INTERVALS IF EXTRA DOSAGE LINES ARE 
C  INCLUDED.

C  EX: TIME   IV   BOLUS	TIME   IV   BOLUS
C       0    100     0		 0    100     0
C       5    100   1000		 2    100   1000  

C  NOTE THAT BOTH ABOVE CASES SHOULD GIVE THE SAME RESULTS IF THERE IS
C  A TIME-LAG = 3 IN THE 2ND CASE. BUT, AS THE CODE IS WRITTEN IN
C  SHIFT.FOR, THE 2ND CASE WOULD TRANSLATE TO THE FOLLOWING:

C	 TIME   IV   BOLUS 
C         0    100     0   
C         2    100     0
C         5    100   1000

C  ... AND THIS WOULD MEAN THAT THE 1ST INTEGRATION BY DVODE WOULD END
C      AT T = 2, RATHER THAN 5 (OR, E.G., 3 IF 3 WAS THE
C      FIRST OBSERVATION TIME). THIS CREATES NUMERICAL DIFFERENCES DUE
C      TO SMALL ROUNDOFF ERRORS WHICH CAN GROW SIGNIFICANTLY.

C  SHIFT.FOR IS A MODULE WHICH INCLUDES SUBROUTINE SHIFT. SHIFT WILL BE
C  CALLED BY ROUTINES OF THE "BIG" NPEM AND IT2B PROGRAMS WHICH HAVE
C  SUBROUTINES FUNC, FUNC1, FUNC2, OR FUNC3 IN THEM.

C  SHIFT INPUTS THE DOSAGE REGIMEN VIA THE INPUT ARGUMENTS (SEE BELOW),
C  AND RETURNS AN ALTERED DOSAGE REGIMEN, WHICH HAS EACH BOLUS INPUT 
C  TIME INCREASED BY THE INPUT VALUE OF TAU (THE TIME LAG). NOTE THAT
C  EACH ROW WITH A NON-0 BOLUS INPUT VALUE WILL RESULT IN A NEW ROW IN
C  THE DOSAGE REGIMEN.

C-----------------------------------------------------------------------

C  PROCEDURE FOR THE DOSAGE REGIMEN MODIFICATION:

C  1. ESTABLISH TAU(I) AS THE TIMELAG FOR DRUG I'S BOLUS COLUMN.
C     NO. AS OF SHIFT5.F, THIS VALUE IS INPUT AS AN ARGUMENT.

C  2. ESTABLISH THE IV VALUES AND TIMES INTO XIV(I,J,K). IN PARTICULAR,
C     XIV(I,J,2) IS THE JTH IV VALUE FOR DRUG I, AND XIV(I,J,1) IS THE 
C     TIME THIS IV VALUE FIRST OCCURRED. SET THE LAST TIME TO 1.D29 AS
C     AN INDICATOR THAT THERE ARE NO MORE ENTRIES IN THE ARRAY.

C  3. ESTABLISH THE COVARIATE VALUES AND TIMES INTO COV(I,J,K). IN 
C     PARTICULAR, COV(I,J,2) IS THE JTH VALUE FOR COVARIATE I, AND 
C     COV(I,J,1) IS THE TIME THIS COV VALUE FIRST OCCURRED. SET THE 
C     LAST TIME TO 1.D29 AS AN INDICATOR THAT THERE ARE NO MORE ENTRIES
C     IN THE ARRAY.

C  4. ESTABLISH THE BOLUS VALUES AND TIMES INTO BOL(I,J,K).
C     IN PARTICULAR, BOL(I,J,2) IS THE JTH BOLUS VALUE FOR DRUG I, AND
C     BOL(I,J,1) IS THE TIME THIS BOLUS OCCURRED. THE TIMES FOR EACH
C     BOLUS VALUE ARE THOSE ADJUSTED TIMES FROM THE ASSOCIATED TIMELAGS
C     TAU(I),I=1,NDRUG, FROM STEP 1. SET THE LAST TIME TO 1.D29 AS AN
C     INDICATOR THAT THERE ARE NO MORE ENTRIES IN THE ARRAY.

C  5. REASSIGN THE VALUES IN IV, BOL, AND COV TO THE APPROPRIATE ENTRIES
C     OF RS, KEEPING TRACK OF THE RUNNING INDEX, ND, OF DOSE EVENTS. IF
C     ND EXCEEDS 5000, STOP THE PROGRAM WITH A MESSAGE TO THE USER. ALSO
C     REASSIGN THE CORRESPONDING TIME VALUES TO ARRAY SIG.


C  STEP 1.

C  NOTHING TO DO. AS OF SHIFT5.F, TAU(I), I=1,NDRUG, IS INPUT AS
C  AN ARGUMENT TO THIS ROUTINE.


C  STEP 2:

C  ESTABLISH THE IV VALUES AND TIMES INTO XIV(I,J,K). IN PARTICULAR,
C  XIV(I,J,2) IS THE JTH IV VALUE FOR DRUG I, AND XIV(I,J,1) IS THE 
C  TIME THIS IV VALUE FIRST OCCURRED.

	DO I = 1,NDRUG

C  ESTABLISH XIV(I,J,K) FOR DRUG I'S IV. PRESET THE LAST VALUE TO
C  -99 SO THAT THE FIRST VALUE WILL BE DIFFERENT AND THEREFORE ENGAGE 
C  THE LOGIC (WHICH ONLY WRITES A ROW INTO THE ARRAY IF THE VALUE IS
C  DIFFERENT THAN THE PREVIOUS VALUE). 

C*** MODIFICATION IN SHIFT4.F: IF A TIME RESET OCCURS (I.E., A
C    SIG(IDOSE) = 0, WHERE IDOSE > 1), IT WILL BE HANDLED BY ASSIGNING 
C    AN EXTRA TIME VALUE OF 1.D19 (I.E., A LARGE VALUE REPRESENTING
C    TIME = INFINITY) TO THE IV TIME ARRAY. THEN THE REST OF THE
C    THE IV TIME ARRAY WILL BE ESTABLISHED WITH THE REST OF THE VALUES
C    IN SIG, STARTING, OF COURSE, WITH THE TIME RESET VALUE OF 0.

C    THE SAME LOGIC WILL APPLY TO THE COVARIATES AND THE BOLI.

C  NOTE THAT IND WILL BE THE RUNNING INDEX OF THE LATEST ENTRY INTO 
C  THE ARRAY. PLACE 1.D29 INTO THE LAST TIME ENTRY OF EACH SUB-ARRAY 
C  AS AN INDICATOR THAT THERE ARE NO MORE ENTRIES.

        IF(NADD .GT. 0) THEN

	DO I = 1, NADD

C  ESTABLISH COV(I,J,K) FOR COVARIATE NO. I.
C  PRESET THE LAST VALUE TO -99 SO THAT THE FIRST VALUE WILL BE 
C  DIFFERENT AND THEREFORE ENGAGE THE LOGIC (WHICH ONLY WRITES A ROW 
C  INTO THE ARRAY IF THE VALUE IS DIFFERENT THAN THE PREVIOUS VALUE). 
C  NOTE THAT IND WILL BE THE RUNNING INDEX OF THE LATEST ENTRY INTO THE

C*** THE FOLLOWING CODE IS CHANGED IN SHIFT8.F. NOW BOLUS VALUES 
C  WORK PROPERLY EVEN WITH TIMELAGS. AND AN ADDITIONAL SUBTLE CHANGE
C  WAS ADDED IN shift9.f (SEE THE COMMENTS AT THE TOP OF shift9.f),
C  AND THE EXTRA COMMENTS BELOW.


C  LOGIC IS NOW AS FOLLOWS:

C  IF SIG(IDOSE) = 0, THIS IS A TIME RESET WHICH IS NOT THE START OF
C     A STEADY STATE DOSE SET. IN THIS CASE, A BOLUS WITH A TIMELAG OF
C     TAU(I) WILL OCCUR AT SIG(IDOSE) + TAU(I) = TAU(I).

C  IF SIG(IDOSE) < 0, THIS IS A TIME RESET WHICH IS THE START OF A
C     STEADY STATE DOSE SET. IN THIS CASE:
C     THE BOLUS TIME WILL BE TAU(I) ONLY IF BOTH TAU(I) AND RR
C     ARE NOT 0. OTHERWISE, IT WILL BE SIG(IDOSE).
C     REASON: IF RR = 0, THERE IS NO BOLUS TO BE GIVEN, SO IT WOULD
C     BE SILLY TO INCLUDE AN EXTRA LINE IN THE DOSAGE REGIMEN WITH
C     A 0 BOLUS (AND IT WOULD VERY SLIGHTLY CHANGE THE RESULTS SINCE
C     THE NUMERICAL INTEGRATION THEN HAS TO INTEGRATE THROUGH AN EXTRA
C     TIME). IN AN EXAMPLE (REMARK 4.b IN NPAG109.EXP, THIS CHANGED THE
C     VALUES IN THE LOG-LIKELIHOODS OUT IN THE 13TH DIGIT, BUT SOME 
C     VALUES IN THE DENSITY FILE WERE CHANGED IN THE 4TH DIGIT).

C     ALSO, IF TAU(I) = 0, THE BOLUS HAS NO TIMELAG AND THEREFORE
C     OCCURS AT SIG(IDOSE).

C  THE FOLLOWING EXAMPLE SHOWS WHY A NON-0 BOLUS IN A STEADY STATE DOSE
C  SET, WITH TAU(I) .NE. 0, MUST BE GIVEN AT TAU(I) AND NOT
C  SIG(IDOSE) + TAU(I).

C  EX: IF SIG(IDOSE) = -12, IT MEANS THAT A STEADY STATE DOSE SET IS
C      STARTING WITH AN INTERDOSE INTERVAL OF 12 HOURS. SO, IF A 
C      BOLUS WITH A TLAG OF 1.5 HOURS IS GIVEN, ITS TIME MUST BE
C      1.5, NOT -12 + 1.5 = -10.5. REASON: AFTER THE SIG(IDOSE) OF
C      -12 IS CONVERTED IN SUBROUTINE FUNC2 TO 0, THE 1.5 WILL CORRECTLY
C      INDICATE THAT THE BOLUS IS GIVEN 1.5 HOURS AFTER THE START OF THE
C      STEADY STATE DOSE SET. ALSO, A TIME OF -10.5 WOULD COMPLETELY
C      SCREW UP THE FUNC2 LOGIC WHICH WOULD INTERPRET IT AS THE START
C      OF ANOTHER STEADY STATE DOSE SEST.

C      ON THE OTHER HAND, IF A DRUG HAS A TAU(I) = 0, IT CANNOT SHOW
C      UP AS OCCURRING AT TAU(I) = 0 SINCE THIS WILL COMPLETELY SCREW
C      UP FUNC2'S LOGIC, WHICH WILL INTERPRET THE TIME OF 0 AS A
C      TIME RESET EVENT. IN THIS CASE, THE BOLUS OCCURS AT THE START OF
C      THE STEADY STATE DOSE SET, I.E., AT SIG(IDOSE) = -12, WHICH WILL
C      BE CONVERTED TO 0 BY FUNC2).


      CALL THESAME(SIG(IDOSE),0.D0,ISAME1)
      CALL THESAME(TAU(I),0.D0,ISAME2)
      CALL THESAME(RR,0.D0,ISAME3)

      IF(ISAME1 .EQ. 1) BOL(I,IND,1) = TAU(I)
C  NOTE THAT, TECHNICALLY, WE SHOULD SET BOL(I,IND,1) = SIG(IDOSE) = 0
C  IF RR = 0, SINCE THERE IS NO REASON TO HAVE AN EXTRA LINE IN THE
C  DOSAGE REGIMEN FOR A 0 BOLUS ... BUT CHANGING THIS WOULD CHANGE
C  VERY SLIGHTLY THE RESULTS IN A 0 BOLUS CASE SINCE THERE WOULD BE ONE
C  LESS DOSAGE LINE FOR THE NUMERICAL INTEGRATOR TO INTEGRATE THROUGH,
C  SO THE CODE WILL BE LEFT AS IS, FOR CONSISTENCY SAKE.


      IF(ISAME1 .EQ. 0) THEN
       BOL(I,IND,1) = SIG(IDOSE)
       IF(ISAME2 .EQ. 0 .AND. ISAME3 .EQ. 0) BOL(I,IND,1) = TAU(I)

	    GO TO 400

	  ENDIF

C  TO GET HERE, THIS DOSE LINE DOES NOT REPRESENT A TIME RESET.


	  IF(RR .NE. 0.D0) THEN

           IND = IND + 1

C  *** CHANGE FOR SHIFT8.F.
C  NOW BOLUS VALUES CAN OCCUR IN STEADY STATE DOSES. AND IF THEY DO,
C  THE FIRST ONE MUST OCCUR AT TIME TAU(I), NOT SIG(IDOSE) + TAU(I)
C  AS THE FOLLOWING EXAMPLE ILLUSTRATES:
C  EX: SIG(1) = -12 INDICATING THAT THE STEADY STATE DOSE SET HAS
C      AN INTERDOSE INTERVAL OF 12 HOURS. TAU(1) = 1.5 -->
C      DRUG 1 HAS A TIMELAG OF 1.5 HOURS. SO, IF THE FIRST BOLUS TIME IS
C      SET =  SIG(1) + TAU(1) = -12 + 1.5 = -10.5, THIS WILL SCREW
C      UP THE FUNC2 LOGIC SINCE IN THAT CODE, THE FIRST TIME OF
C      -12 WILL BE RESET TO BE 0, AND THIS WILL BE FOLLOWED BY -10.5,
C      WHICH WILL LOOK LIKE THE START OF ANOTHER STEADY STATE DOSE
C      SET. INSTEAD, SET FIRST BOLUS TIME = TAU(1) = 1.5, WHICH IS
C      CORRECT SINCE IT OCCURS 1.5 HOURS AFTER THE STEADY STATE DOSE
C      STARTS.

         IF(SIG(IDOSE) .GE. 0.D0) BOL(I,IND,1) = SIG(IDOSE) + TAU(I)
         IF(SIG(IDOSE) .LT. 0.D0) BOL(I,IND,1) = TAU(I)

	   BOL(I,IND,2) = RR
	   BOL(I,IND+1,1) = 1.D29
	  ENDIF

  400     CONTINUE

	 END DO

C  THE ABOVE END DO IS FOR THE  DO IDOSE = 1,ND  LOOP.


	END DO


C  THE ABOVE END DO IS FOR THE  DO I = 1,NDRUG  LOOP.



C  STEP 5:

C  REASSIGN THE VALUES IN IV, BOL, AND COV TO THE APPROPRIATE ENTRIES
C  OF RS, KEEPING TRACK OF THE RUNNING INDEX, ND, OF DOSE EVENTS. IF
C  ND EXCEEDS 5000, STOP THE PROGRAM WITH A MESSAGE TO THE USER. ALSO,
C  REASSIGN THE CORRESPONDING TIME VALUES TO ARRAY SIG.

	NI = 2*NDRUG + NADD
	ND = 0

C  GO THROUGH THE ARRAYS IV, BOL, AND COV TO DETERMINE THE NEXT
C  LOWEST DOSE TIME. PUT THIS VALUE INTO RS, ALONG WITH THE 
C  CORRESPONDING VALUES FOR THE IV'S, THE BOLI, AND THE COVARIATES.

C  IN THE LOOP BELOW, IT IS NECESSARY TO KNOW TO WHAT POINT IN THE
C  IV, BOL, AND COV ARRAYS THE TIMES AND VALUES HAVE ALREADY BEEN 
C  STORED INTO RS. THESE INDICES ARE INDIV(I), I=1,NDRUG; INDBOL(I),
C  I=1,NDRUG; AND INDCOV(I), I=1,NADD, RESPECTIVELY. E.G., 
C  INDIV(2) = 4 MEANS THAT ALL VALUES IN THE IV, BOL, AND COV ARRAYS, 
C  THROUGH THE 4TH TIME FOR IV DRUG 2 (I.E., THROUGH TIME = XIV(2,4,1))
C  HAVE BEEN OR ARE ABOUT TO BE STORED INTO THE RS ARRAY.

C  SO PRESET ALL THESE INDEX INDICATORS = 1, AND INITIALIZE THE
