//! PMcore is a framework for developing and running non-parametric algorithms for population pharmacokinetic modelling
//!
//! The framework is designed to be modular and flexible, allowing for easy integration of new algorithms and methods. It is heavily designed around the specifications for Pmetrics, a package for R, and is designed to be used in conjunction with it. However, as a general rust library, it can be used for a wide variety of applications, not limited to pharmacometrics.
//!
//! # Configuration
//!
//! PMcore is configured using [routines::settings::Settings], which specifies the settings for the program.
//!
//! # Data format
//!
//! PMcore is heavily linked to [pharmsol], which provides the data structures and routines for handling pharmacokinetic data. The data is stored in a [pharmsol::Data] structure, and can either be read from a CSV file, using [pharmsol::data::parse_pmetrics::read_pmetrics], or created dynamically using the [pharmsol::data::builder::SubjectBuilder].
