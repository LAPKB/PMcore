/// Implements the adaptive grid algorithm for support point expansion.
///
/// This function generates up to 2 new support points in each dimension for each existing support point.
/// New support points are symmetrically placed around the original support point, at a distance of `eps` * (range_max - range_min).
/// If the new support point is too close to an existing support point, or it is outside the given range, it is discarded.
///
/// # Arguments
///
/// * `theta` - A mutable reference to a 2D array representing the existing support points.
/// * `eps` - A floating-point value representing the fraction of the range to use for generating new support points.
/// * `ranges` - A slice of tuples representing the range of values for each dimension.
/// * `min_dist` - A floating-point value representing the minimum distance between support points.
///
/// # Returns
///
/// A 2D array containing the updated support points after the adaptive grid expansion.
///
